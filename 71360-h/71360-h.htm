<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/deco.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> in the London Square a dismal November
fog mingled with the gathering twilight, and
blotted out the trees and the opposite houses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trelawney’s drawing-room, where the
fire burnt clear, and the softly shaded lamps
shed a subdued light, was very pleasant by contrast.
Mrs. Trelawney herself sat on one side
of the fire in a low seat, beside which a small
table was drawn up, covered with multi-colored
silks for the embroidery she held.</p>

<p>“Are you very busy just now?” she asked
presently of a man who sat leaning back in an
arm-chair opposite her on the other side of the
table.</p>

<p>“Busy? Stevens is never busy,” her husband
assured her. He rose lazily from the sofa
as he spoke, and sat down on the arm of his
wife’s chair. “He sits in his den before a good
fire, with a novel in one hand, and the editorial
cigar in the other; and that’s what he calls
hard work!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Stevens groaned. “May you never do anything
harder! You don’t mention the <i>kind</i> of
novel over which I’m usually to be found
gnashing my teeth!”</p>

<p>“Poor man! as bored and savage as all that?”
Mrs. Trelawney asked, smiling. “But you get
a good one sometimes, of course.”</p>

<p>“Once in three months, perhaps. Oh! there
are mitigations of misery, I allow. Last night,
for instance, I reviewed a book that interested
me. It was good; <i>very</i> good,” he added, meditatively.</p>

<p>“A new writer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or new to me, at least. It was a
woman’s book,—not the usual woman’s novel
with a capital W, though, Heaven be praised!
The writer’s name is Bridget Ruan. I don’t
know whether—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trelawney dropped her needlework with
an exclamation. She turned swiftly to her husband,
her eyes shining.</p>

<p>“How splendid!” she said softly, a thrill of
excitement and triumph in her voice.</p>

<p>“You know her?” Stevens inquired curiously.</p>

<p>“She is my great friend.” Mrs. Trelawney
lifted her head proudly as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Why, <i>you</i> know Bridget Ruan, Mr. Stevens!”
she exclaimed, a moment later. “She used to
stop with me years ago, after we both left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
school, you know. You were very much
interested in her—”</p>

<p>“Not the clever little girl, whose father—”</p>

<p>“Yes!” she cried, interrupting him in her
eagerness. “I forgot that you have never met
her since. You’ve been away much too long!”</p>

<p>“Really? Strange that I shouldn’t have
known, I mean,” he returned, raising himself a
little on one elbow to talk. “I remember her
perfectly, of course, but her name had escaped
me. Well, it’s a clever story, a <i>very</i> clever
story. Strong, but delicate too. No screaming—no
rant—but it tells. You have seen it,
perhaps?</p>

<p>“She was a striking girl,” he went on musingly.
“Is she as beautiful as she promised to be?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trelawney rose, and crossed the room to
a cabinet, from which she took a photograph.
She put it silently into his hands.</p>

<p>The editor stood up, and moved nearer the
light.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, after a moment’s scrutiny.
“I remember her face. But she has altered.
It was a face full of possibilities. Some of
them have become realities, I should say. Yes,
she is beautiful—<i>really</i> beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve raised yourself, if possible,
several inches in Helen’s estimation,” her
husband said with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Mrs. Trelawney made no remark. She took
the photograph gently from Stevens, and, re-crossing
the room, put it in its place. There
was the suggestion of a caress in the little
touch with which she settled the frame, before
she returned to her seat.</p>

<p>Then she took up her work, and bent over
it a moment without speaking.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” she said presently,—and as she
raised her head, Stevens thought he detected a
trace of tears; “and <i>she’ll</i> be so glad you think
well of her book. You must meet her again.
I will arrange it. She hasn’t forgotten <i>you</i>.
Why, it was you who first praised her work,
don’t you remember?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART I</h2>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirteen</span> or fourteen years before the afternoon
when Bridget Ruan’s novel was discussed in
Mrs. Trelawney’s sitting-room, she and Bridget
were school-girls at Eastchester.</p>

<p>Saturday was a holiday at Myrtle Lodge,—Miss
Brownrigg’s boarding-house for the Eastchester
High School girls,—and tennis was in
full swing in the school-garden behind the house.</p>

<p>“Play!” “Forty-love!” “Vantage all!”
came shrilly from the tennis court. On a side
grass-plot, whose trampled, badly kept turf bore
witness to the violence of the game, rounders
was being played by the little ones, who
screamed themselves hoarse, and danced madly
in a frenzy of excitement as one small figure
after another flew round the course, and avoided
the savagely aimed ball.</p>

<p>Several of the older girls strolled quietly
along the gravel paths, with arms interlaced,
whispering together in the peculiarly confidential
“penny-mystery” fashion of school-girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Where’s Bridget? Where’s Bridget Ruan?”
one of the tennis-players called suddenly.
“We’re making up a new set, and we want
her!”</p>

<p>“Bid! Bid! Bridget, where are you?” two
or three of them began to call.</p>

<p>Bridget shook her hair over her ears to deaden
the sound, and went on writing.</p>

<p>She sat in a little dilapidated arbor in a far
corner of the garden. It contained a rickety,
dusty table, on which papers and books were
untidily scattered. The arbor was surrounded
by long rank grass, uncut since the spring,
and drenched with the recent rains. The path
she had made for herself through it was plainly
visible in the trampled, broken-down stalks
which extended up to the door.</p>

<p>The summer-house was screened from the rest
of the garden by a clump of lime-trees, and in
spite of frequent impatient calls, Bridget had
been in possession the whole of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Bid! Bridget!” the cries grew louder and
more urgent.</p>

<p>“Bother!” whispered the girl, stamping her
foot impatiently and writing faster.</p>

<p>“Bridget! Miss Ruggles wants you. Where
are you?”</p>

<p>The girl uttered a smothered, furious exclamation,
but otherwise paid no attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“She’s never in the summer-house, through
all this awfully wet grass!” she heard a nearer
voice exclaim. “Run and see, Dulcie; your
frocks are short!”</p>

<p>There was a rustling in the grass outside, and
in a moment a small child stood examining her
damp stockings on the threshold.</p>

<p>Bridget raised her head with an impatient jerk,
and confronted her visitor with an angry, “<i>Well?</i>”</p>

<p>Heavy masses of curling, copper-colored hair
hung round her face to her shoulders. It was
a small, delicately tinted face, with a dainty,
pointed chin, and a pair of big gray eyes. They
were singularly bright and restless eyes, and
when she was angry they blazed royally.</p>

<p>She was angry now, and the small child
shrank back.</p>

<p>“I—I—Alice sent me. Miss Ruggles wants
you,” she stammered.</p>

<p>“<i>Confound!</i>” Bridget exclaimed with frank
emphasis, snatching up her papers and bundling
them into a book.</p>

<p>She rushed out of the arbor like a whirlwind,
and the child cowered against the door as she
passed. Half way through the long grass she
recalled the frightened action, and turned
impetuously back.</p>

<p>“All right, Dulcie! I’m not angry with
<i>you</i>,” she said, bending over the little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Dulcie flung her arms round her, and kissed
her rapturously, tears of fright still in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“You may carry up my books for prep. to-night,
and bring me the biscuits at supper,”
Bridget whispered consolingly, disengaging herself
with a hasty kiss.</p>

<p>Miss Ruggles was upstairs in the bedroom,
stooping over an open drawer, as the girl
entered, panting and frowning.</p>

<p>“<i>Look</i> at this drawer again, Bridget!” she
cried angrily. “What do you come to school
for, I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“To be bothered from morning till night,”
was the prompt, unreflecting reply.</p>

<p>Miss Ruggles stopped in her work of tidying,
and stared hopelessly at her for a moment.</p>

<p>“You will be reported, of course,” she said at
last, in a voice which indicated that she knew
the uselessness of the punishment, but was
compelled to inflict it for want of another more
efficacious. She began to expostulate and argue
in querulous, futile fashion, turning over the
contents of the drawer with an air of impotent
exasperation. She had just laid her hand on a
large, untidy bundle of papers, when, with a
swift movement, Bridget swooped upon it, and
tucked it under her arm.</p>

<p>“These are <i>private</i>,” she announced breathlessly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
shot an annihilating glance at Miss
Ruggles, and dashed unceremoniously out of
the room.</p>

<p>Down below in the garden Helen Mansfield,
her special friend, was sitting alone on the
grass near the house reading.</p>

<p>Bridget swept up to her. “Come along!
Come into the arbor! Let us talk!” she cried
imperiously.</p>

<p>Helen rose and followed her.</p>

<p>“Well! what did she want you for?” she
inquired, when the arbor was reached.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Bridget shrugged her shoulders contemptuously.
“Another row! Bedroom untidy
or something. I’m reported again; so I thought
it was waste of time to listen to all Miss
Ruggles’ talk, as well as Miss Brownrigg’s,
this evening, and I came away in the middle.”</p>

<p>“Bid!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d have thought I’d broken all
the Ten Commandments, instead of leaving my
brush and comb out of the bag! What idiots
teachers are! They mix up all the big things
with the little ones, as though they were all
crimes equally. Oh! a boarding-school’s a
beast of an institution! Worry, worry, worry,
about trifles from morning till night. And
Miss Brownrigg calls this ‘preparation for life.’
Does life mean tidy wardrobes, and words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
underlined with red ink without any smudges,
and sums all worked the way of the book or else
they’re not right even when the answers are the
same? If so, I don’t think it’s worth preparing
for.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ruggles isn’t worth exciting one’s self
about,” returned the other girl, calmly.</p>

<p>“Not for <i>you</i>, of course. You haven’t any
temper. But I’m not made like that. I go
<i>mad</i>. I wish I didn’t.” She flung herself
down on the seat beside her friend, and there
was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>The sunshine filtered through the chinks in
the pine-log roof of the summer-house, and fell
in little pools and splashes of light on the table,
and on the girls’ summer dresses. Shadows of
the lime-trees outside danced lightly, and flickered
on the rough walls, and brought a sense of
dainty stir and flutter into the arbor.</p>

<p>Presently Bridget moved, and broke into a
laugh.</p>

<p>“What a <i>duffer</i> Miss Ruggles is!” she exclaimed,
her eyes dancing. “I’m so <i>furious</i>
when rows are going on that I don’t notice the
absurd things she says; but they come upon me
afterwards. Just now, for instance, she said it
was ‘my duty to keep my linen-drawer tidy,
because <i>Christ might come at any moment</i>.’ I
must put <i>that</i> in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“In? Where?”</p>

<p>Bridget started, and her color rose. “Oh!
never mind!” she began.</p>

<p>“What’s in that parcel?” her friend asked,
her eyes falling for the first time on the packet
Bridget had thrown beside her.</p>

<p>She did not reply for a moment; then she said
desperately, “Well, that’s <i>it</i>. My story, you
know. I’ve put every one nearly in,—Miss
Ruggles and Mademoiselle and Miss Jones, and
a good many of the girls. Not <i>exactly</i>, of
course, but something like. It’s very stupid,”
she added perfunctorily. Then, with a quick
change of voice, “No, it’s silly to say that,
just because <i>I</i> wrote it. I <i>don’t</i> think it’s
stupid; but I daresay you wouldn’t care for
it.”</p>

<p>“Let me see.”</p>

<p>“I’ll—I’ll read it to you, if you like.” She
blushed again. “Will you tell me what you
think of it, Helen? What you <i>really</i> think of
it?” she repeated anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Helen returned.</p>

<p>Bridget began to read, her nervousness betraying
itself in the breathless gallop at which she
rushed through the first page,—a pace which
steadily diminished, however, as she grew accustomed
to the sound of her own voice. Then she
began to do her work justice by intonation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
emphasis, encouraged by an occasional spontaneous
laugh from her friend.</p>

<p>It was a crude enough little story of school
life; badly constructed, of course, though not
without a certain redeeming vigor of its own.
The characters, although inclining towards caricatures
of their originals, were boldly drawn,
with a touch of daring humor. The whole thing
was curiously realistic. The girl had indulged
in no flights of imagination or rhetoric. She had
observed keenly, portrayed faithfully, if somewhat
mercilessly, after the manner of the young.
There was about it an indication of power rather
remarkable in a school-girl effusion.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Bridget, looking up as she
dropped the last sheet. “Well?” It was
uttered a little breathlessly, and she leant forward
in her eagerness, propping her chin on her
hands, her elbows resting on the table.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned her friend, slowly, “I like it.
You have made the people seem real, but—”
She paused.</p>

<p>“<i>But</i>,” repeated Bridget, impatiently. “Do
go on, Helen!”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to think what my father would
say.”</p>

<p>Bridget’s face darkened; she began to fidget
impatiently with the paper in front of her; but
Helen was looking at the sunlit leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“I think he would say the <i>style</i> was bad,—might
be improved,” she said, unconsciously substituting
a phrase of the professor’s for her own.</p>

<p>“Style?” Bridget repeated. “What do you
mean? What <i>is</i> style?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know quite; it’s difficult to explain.
Father would tell you. It’s a <i>way</i> of saying
things, I think.”</p>

<p>“But you said I had made them <i>real</i> people!”
Bridget protested.</p>

<p>“So you have.”</p>

<p>“Well! what does it matter how I put the
words, as long as I’ve done that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it <i>does</i>. Father says it
is very important. Cultivated people—”</p>

<p>“But I’m not a cultivated person, you see!”
Bridget returned fiercely, her face flushing.
“I don’t belong to cultivated people, and I
don’t know how to finick, and be mincing, and
awfully refined in writing, any more than in
talking. If <i>that’s</i> what style means, I’d rather
be without it, and say straight out what I mean,
and what I see. I should hate to be such a
<i>young lady</i>”—there was an accent of fierce contempt
in the words—“as—as—”</p>

<p>“As <i>I</i> am, for instance,” put in Helen,
quietly. “But I thought we were talking about
style. I don’t know why people can’t write
down what they see, and yet have good style.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>But Bridget was not attending. She had
flung out her arms across the table, and, with her
head buried in them, was sobbing convulsively.</p>

<p>Helen paused a moment; then she bent over
the girl and kissed her hair.</p>

<p>At her touch Bridget sprang up.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m a beast—a <i>beast</i>!” she cried
incoherently. “I’m always being so hateful to
you; and it isn’t your fault.... Only, Helen,
I can’t help it, I’m so jealous, so horribly
jealous!” She paused, sobbing uncontrollably.</p>

<p>“But why, Bid, dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is hateful, I know,” Bridget whispered;
“but if you only knew how I envy you
your sort of home, your kind of father. <i>You</i>
always live with people who are ladies and
gentlemen. They talk about interesting things,—books
and pictures; and they are—the word
you used—they are <i>cultivated</i> people. Sometimes—O
Helen, I can’t help it—I almost <i>hate</i>
you, for knowing all you do, so easily. It all
comes so naturally to you. And <i>I</i> want it too!”
she exclaimed passionately. “What I said just
now wasn’t true. You knew it wasn’t true. I
<i>should</i> like to have style—and—and—all the
rest. I want to know the sort of people <i>you</i>
know. I shall <i>never</i> care for any others. And I
never can,” she added bitterly, “just because,—oh!
it’s awful, just as though it <i>were</i> a crime!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“But, Bridget,” protested her friend, soothingly,
“you are so clever! When you are grown
up, you will write books. People will <i>want</i> to
know you then. Even the stupid people, who— Besides,”
she continued hastily, leaving the
sentence unfinished, “you <i>are</i> a lady. Nothing
can alter that; any one can see it. Why, even
that wretched Lena Mildmay—”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Bridget, unheeding, “and there
again is a worse trouble. I <i>hate</i> myself, Helen;
it seems so mean to say anything, even to <i>you</i>,
that seems—that seems—” She hesitated, her
lips trembling. There was silence for a moment.
“Oh! you <i>know</i> I love my mother, Helen,”
she whispered brokenly; “but—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Bid, darling!” Helen interposed,
in a voice that was already womanly in its
tenderness.</p>

<p>There was another short silence, and then
Bridget jumped up.</p>

<p>“That’s enough of the dumps!” she said,
with a vivid gesture. “You are an angel;
and what are my eyes like? Dare I meet the
others? or will that little duffer, Mary Molton,
say, ‘What’s the matter, Bridget? Have you
been <i>crying</i>?’ Come along; let’s play tennis!
My style’s good enough <i>there</i>, anyway,” she
added mischievously, with a flashing backward
glance at Helen, who was picking her way
through the wet grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>It was four years since Miss Brownrigg,
departing from her “usual rule,” took a tradesman’s
daughter as a boarder at Myrtle House.
Times were hard in the educational as well as
the outside world, and tradesmen had this saving
grace,—they usually paid promptly. Besides,
Bridget’s home was a distant one, and, as
Miss Brownrigg remarked to her sister, it was
very unlikely the other girls would ever know,—“unless,
of course,” she added with a sigh,
folding up a check for entrance fees paid in
advance,—“unless the child is very uncouth,
which is unfortunately to be expected.”</p>

<p>Miss Brownrigg’s expectations were, however,
falsified in both particulars.</p>

<p>In the first place, Bridget was not uncouth.
In the second, she speedily left no doubt in the
minds of her school-fellows as to the nature of
her social position. It was with considerable
relief that Miss Brownrigg saw a slender, graceful
little girl emerge from the cab which
brought her to the door on the first day of
term.</p>

<p>“My dear Eliza,” she observed, “the child is
not merely presentable,—she is <i>pretty</i>; she has
style. She is even dressed well,—simply, I’m
glad to say, but <i>well</i>. We sha’n’t have much
trouble.”</p>

<p>This was when the drawing-room door had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
closed upon Bridget after the first interview,
and she was following the maid upstairs to her
bedroom,—a dejected little figure, with bent
head and trembling lips.</p>

<p>And, in the particular way she expected, Miss
Brownrigg was right.</p>

<p>The one or two hardly noticeable peculiarities
of phrase and pronunciation—which to a very
close observer indicated that her home was not
on the same level of refinement as the rest of
her school-fellows’—the child corrected herself
before she had been in the house a month.
She never made a mistake twice. The English
teacher, who was observant, noticed that she was
at first morbidly sensitive on the subject.</p>

<p>Her mental character, as disclosed in the
monthly conclave of teachers, was rather distractingly
diverse. She was a dunce, incorrigibly
idle, and a genius, according to varying
accounts; but they all with one accord lifted
up their voices and denounced her iniquities.</p>

<p>With the girls her popularity was undeniable,
and the public disclosure of her social status
notwithstanding, she retained it during the
whole of her school life.</p>

<p>At the beginning of her second term at
Myrtle House, a child about her own age came
to school for the first time. Bridget always
made much of the new girls, flying in the face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
of the time-honored tradition that they were
to be treated as interlopers, and not allowed to
display any “cheek” for several weeks.</p>

<p>“The stupidest idea I ever heard,” she declared,
“just when they feel loneliest, and most miserable,
to treat them badly, in case they should
have <i>cheek</i>! Is it likely they’d feel cheeky
the first fortnight, poor things? Did <i>you</i> feel
cheeky? You cried for nights and nights. You
<i>know</i> you did. So did I.”</p>

<p>Essie Langford—who had been petted and
dosed with chocolates whenever she was discovered
with her head in her locker, dissolved in
tears, like a miserable little ostrich—naturally
lost her heart to Bridget, and abandoned the
idea of suicide.</p>

<p>“Will you let me be your friend?” she whispered
one day, creeping up to her. Bridget sat
in her favorite attitude, curled up on the floor,
with her book on the sofa.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she returned, raising abstracted
eyes for a second from the open page.</p>

<p>“Well, now let us tell each other what our
fathers are,” said Essie, confidentially, lowering
her voice, and glancing apprehensively round.
“Mine has a <i>sort</i> of business, you know,—not
a <i>shop</i>, of course,” she added hastily, “because
there are wire blinds up at the windows, but—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to know what your <i>father</i> is,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Bridget replied scornfully, forgetting her book.
“What does it matter? I don’t know him. I
know <i>you</i>, not your father.”</p>

<p>The girls were assembling for preparation of
home lessons. They gradually drifted, as they
generally did, over to Bridget’s side of the
room.</p>

<p>“What does Bridget say, the darlint?” one
of them inquired.</p>

<p>“She says it doesn’t matter what your father
is,” Essie replied in a low voice, blushing
furiously.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t matter?” echoed one of the elder
girls. “Of <i>course</i> it matters.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Bridget broke out, wheeling round
and facing her.</p>

<p>“Why? Oh, well—because— Well, it decides
whether <i>you</i> are a lady.”</p>

<p>“How can your <i>father</i> decide that?” asked
Bridget, hotly. “He is not <i>you</i>. You are
<i>yourself</i>. <i>You</i> decide that. What do you mean
by a lady?”</p>

<p>“Some one whose father is a gentleman,”
replied Lena, obstinately. “And you can
always tell who <i>is</i> the daughter of a gentleman.
<i>You’re</i> a lady, Bid, of course. If your father
had been a butcher or baker or candlestick-maker,
you’d have been quite different. Your
face would have been different; you’d have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
ugly broad hands, instead of nice thin little
ones, like yours.” She took one of them with
a caress, and tried to draw the girl down beside
her on the sofa, but Bridget drew back. “You
would dress horribly,—in bad taste, like those
Higginses in church, the grocer people, you
know. But <i>your</i> frocks are <i>sweet</i>,” she went on,
stroking Bridget’s pink cotton skirt admiringly.</p>

<p>“Oh! and then you’d have a horrid uneducated
voice. And altogether,—any one can
tell a lady. It’s nonsense to say it doesn’t
matter who your father is. Why, nobody knows
a person whose father is not a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” some of the girls echoed.
Others were discreetly silent. One or two
remembered reassuringly that mamma always
spoke of “your father’s office,” and added, “Of
course not!” a little late, but very emphatically.</p>

<p>“Well, then, listen!” cried Bridget, her
voice ringing imperatively. “I don’t care who
hears! Listen! and see how <i>stupid</i> you all are!
I suppose you don’t call a man who keeps a
public house a gentleman. Well, I’m the
daughter of a man who keeps a public house.”</p>

<p>There was dead silence. A sort of undefinable
flutter of surprise and consternation was in
the air. Unconsciously the girls fell back a
pace or two. Bridget noticed it, and threw up
her head defiantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“And you’ve all known me, and made a fuss
over me, for a year, and <i>thought I was a lady</i>,”
she said mockingly, looking round at them with
slow scorn. “You can’t even discover a lady for
yourselves. You have to wait to be told that
she isn’t one. But half of you,” she cried,
glancing at them one after another contemptuously,
“will be like that as long as you live.
You’ll always <i>belong</i> to some one. You’ll be
afraid to be <i>yourselves</i>. There! now you know
who my father is, and you may do just as you
like about ‘knowing’ me, as you call it. Half
of you <i>I</i> shouldn’t care to know if I wasn’t
obliged; not because of what your fathers are,
but because of what <i>you</i> are,—a set of silly,
tame sheep, who <i>daren’t</i> think for yourselves!”</p>

<p>She paused breathless and shaking, her eyes
blazing. There was a moment’s awkward silence,
and then Helen Mansfield, the head girl, moved
from the door which she had entered just as the
discussion began, and came forward.</p>

<p>“Bid,” she said carelessly, in her usual self-possessed
voice, as though nothing had happened,
“will you come and help me see to the
lockers? It’s my week, and there’s such a lot
to do.”</p>

<p>She put her arm round the girl’s waist, not
effusively, but in ordinary school-girl fashion,
and they left the room together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Helen Mansfield had a certain vogue at Myrtle
House. On points of etiquette she set the
fashion. She was “awfully good style.”</p>

<p>The set of the tide was immediately discernible.
Lena Mildmay, indeed, went off with her
special satellite, murmuring scornfully that “it
was coming to something when you never knew
who you might be associating with,” and she
should “write home about it;” but the others
failed to respond.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of preparation, surreptitious
notes, which caused Bridget to writhe,
continued to be passed to her, as she sat doggedly
working sums, her curly hair hiding her
face.</p>

<p>“Darling Bid, will you walk to church with
me on Sunday?”</p>

<p>“My dearest Bridget, <i>I’m</i> not a sheep, am I?
I’m sure your father must be a very nice gentleman.
Here are some chocolate almonds; but
eat them quietly, because they <i>scrunch</i>, and old
Ruggles hears quickly.”</p>

<p>“My darling Bid, don’t tell any one. My
father is a wine-merchant,—something like
yours, you see; only, of course, it’s <i>wine</i>. But
still, you see, I couldn’t mind much about <i>your</i>
father. Besides,—you’ll never tell, will you?—my
uncle is a socialist, and mother says it’s
a disgrace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Oh, Helen! Helen!” Bridget whispered between
her sobs, kneeling beside her friend’s bed
that night when the lights were out, “what <i>fools</i>
they all are. But I love <i>you</i>. I shall love you
for ever and ever.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fact that, in spite of her promulgation,
Bridget Ruan still led the school, was strikingly
apparent when, two or three months later, the
girls at Myrtle Lodge were converted.</p>

<p>A revivalist preacher passing through Eastchester
was invited to address them, with the
result that more than half the school was
stricken with conversion. The preacher was,
as usually happens in such cases, a man of
powerful personality. He spoke fluently, with a
certain oratorical effect which appealed strongly
to Bridget’s emotional nature. Most of the girls
cried copiously. Bridget sat tearless, but white
to the lips, as the man prayed, almost suffocated
by the violent beating of her heart. Left to
themselves, most of the girls would have forgotten
the service in a week, but Bridget could
not forget. She fanned the wavering flame of
ardor in her school-fellows. She, the leader in
every game, bitterly denounced hare and hounds,
and branded rounders with ignominy. She went
about with fixed gaze and unsmiling lips, meditating
upon the Second Coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>She no longer rushed into the dining-room
just as the door was being closed for prayers,
nor came up flushed and panting when the tail
of the two-and-two procession daily formed to
walk from the boarding-house to the High
School was about to disappear round the corner.</p>

<p>Bridget, in fact, exhibited every sign of that
changed heart whose outward manifestation,
according to school ethics, consists in a subordination
to rules and an immaculate condition of
drawers and lockers,—which, from the teachers’
point of view, makes a school conversion a
blessed and memorable event.</p>

<p>As an outcome of her fiery zeal, Myrtle Lodge
became characterized by a stern, unbending
morality. There were no more whispered conversations
in the bedrooms when the lights were
out and talking prohibited. Self-imposed bad
marks became the order of the day. Even the
games took on a quiet, well-conducted, ecclesiastical
tone. Bridget invented them. One,
which she called <i>Scripture Clocks</i>, consisted in
finding texts for every hour in the day, and
printing them on to a cardboard time-piece,
manufactured for the purpose. She organized,
too, a Saturday afternoon prayer-meeting in the
cloak-room on the ground floor, and this meeting
it was which, in accordance with the irony
of fate, was her undoing. She had been implored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
to take the lead, and offer up prayer herself,
but remembering that the fruit of the Spirit is
meekness, she had reluctantly declined, giving
up her place to an elder girl.</p>

<p>During the prayers she used to kneel beside
one of the stained wooden forms, her face
enveloped in a waterproof which hung straight
and limp from its peg above her head.</p>

<p>She had adopted this attitude, because merely
shutting her eyes was not a sufficient safeguard
against the seduction of the sunlit leaves round
the window, with their background of blue sky.
Concentrating her attention thus severely on the
prayer, Bridget at first listened devoutly, then
less devoutly, and finally began to criticise, and
that was fatal.</p>

<p>“How she stammers and hesitates, and says the
same things over and over again,” she thought,
shaking her hair about her ears in growing irritation.
“Why didn’t <i>I</i> pray when they asked
me?” She began to compose impassioned addresses,
modelled unconsciously on the soul-stirring
exhortations of the preacher who had
so roused her nature. By degrees she ceased
to listen to the halting words of the girl, wrapping
the cloak round her head so that her own
imaginary prayer might be delivered to a sobbing
audience with greater effect, unhindered
by the feeble murmurs of her school-fellow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
This state of affairs lasted through one or two
of the meetings, and then the innings of the
Adversary began.</p>

<p>“How ridiculous it is! How absurd you are,
making up grand speeches to say to God! How
silly it is to be kneeling in this stuffy, dusty
room, telling God things that He knows already!
How <i>disgusting</i> this waterproof smells!”</p>

<p>She jerked it off with an impatient movement,
and it fell upon the head of the girl who knelt
next to her, enveloping her in its voluminous
folds. She struggled wildly to free herself,
“like a cat with its head in a jug,” as Bridget
afterwards described the episode, and she began
to laugh, softly at first; then the desperate
struggles of the girl redoubled themselves so
uncontrollably that the form shook, and Essie
Langford, who knelt at her left, raised her head
sharply, with a sigh of relief when she discovered
the cause. Essie’s conversion at the
best of times hardly deserved the skin-deep description.
Bridget had insisted upon it, as
a matter of fact, and now her shallow, pleasure-loving
little soul rejoiced, foreseeing the
end.</p>

<p>Mary Morton, who was praying, began the
first words of the Lord’s Prayer; and when the
murmur of response was at its fullest, Essie
seized her opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“<i>Bridget!</i>” Bridget had controlled her laughter,
and there was no reply to the whisper.</p>

<p>“<i>Bid!</i>” urged Essie.</p>

<p>“‘Thy will be done’— <i>What?</i>” answered
Bridget. The last word was jerked out impatiently,
as if in spite of herself.</p>

<p>“The little ones are playing rounders, awfully
badly.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet! I know it. Let me think!” she
whispered back fiercely; “‘and lead us not into
temptation,’” she added, mechanically following
the voice of the praying girl.</p>

<p>The <i>Amen</i> was followed by the silence of
private prayer, broken suddenly by a quick,
decided movement from Bridget, who all at once
sprang to her feet. Every head was raised
curiously, and in a moment or two every girl
had risen from her knees.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” Bridget cried, “<i>I</i> began
these meetings, so I ought to tell you I’m not
coming to any more of them. I’m tired of them.
I don’t believe it interests God a bit to see us
all kneeling down in this horrid dusty room; and
He can hear much better prayers in church.”</p>

<p>There was a horrified murmur of “<i>Bridget!</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, so He can, if He likes prayers. <i>I</i>
don’t believe He does, because He <i>never</i>
answers any.... Anyway, it’s fine weather.
I vote we have rounders after tea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>There was a large assembly at rounders that
evening, and Miss Ruggles, shutting her bedroom
window with a bang, remarked to Miss
Shuttleworth, the drawing-mistress, that conversion
and peace were practically at an end.</p>

<p>The fact that Bridget’s mind had been
seriously turned to spiritual matters, however,
was not without permanent result. She had
been unnaturally quiet throughout a Scripture
lesson one Sunday, a month or two after Myrtle
Lodge had resumed its normal tone. Just as
the lesson was finished she said suddenly, fixing
her eyes earnestly on Miss Ruggles,—</p>

<p>“But <i>this</i> is what I want to know,—how do
you know there <i>is</i> a God?”</p>

<p>There was an electric silence.</p>

<p>“And you can read your Bible, Bridget, and
ask me <i>that</i>!” Miss Ruggles replied in an awed
tone.</p>

<p>“But that is just why I <i>do</i> ask. Is there a
way of proving that the Bible is <i>true</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is the way of <i>faith</i>,” Miss Ruggles
returned with impressive solemnity, if defective
logic.</p>

<p>“But that isn’t a <i>proof</i>; it’s a <i>feeling</i>.”</p>

<p>“A feeling which you must try to cultivate,
Bridget. These very foolish ideas spring from
your rebellious nature and defiance of all rules,—your
habit of questioning the authority of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
any one who is set over you. It will lead you
into great sin unless you guard against it watchfully
and with prayer.”</p>

<p>“When I grow up,” said Bridget, abstractedly,
as though following her own train of thought,
“I will find out about these things; but I sha’n’t
believe or disbelieve them yet. There’s no
good in it that I can see.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rilchester</span>, Bridget’s home, was a fair-sized,
bustling market-town.</p>

<p>At the corner of the High Street stood <i>The
Golden Plume</i>, Mr. Ruan’s property, a large,
prosperous-looking public house, with an adjoining
private dwelling.</p>

<p>On the day Bridget left school, Mrs. Ruan sat
in the drawing-room, with her sister, Mrs. Wainright,
a plump, middle-aged woman, who had
married a small farmer and lived at Sidford, a
town some twenty miles distant from Rilchester.</p>

<p>The room in which the two women were
seated was of the uncompromising square description,
with two flat sash-windows overlooking
the High Street. It was furnished in the
style that was fashionable when Mrs. Ruan was
married; but in its accessories, leanings towards
æstheticism, as understood in Rilchester, were
observable. These took the form of Liberty
antimacassars tied over the backs of the gilt
chairs, flights of Japanese fans (partly concealing
the somewhat florid wall paper, with its design<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of yellow roses and butterflies), and sundry
painted tambourines, tied with bunches of colored
ribbons, depending from the walls or perched
jauntily on screens.</p>

<p>The room was incongruous enough, but it did
not lack in detail certain deft, dainty touches,
which indicated that its possessor gave the rein
to her artistic sense as far as, and on the lines
on which it had been developed.</p>

<p>This was best exemplified in the appearance
of Mrs. Ruan herself and her immediate surroundings.
She was a slightly faded but young-looking
woman, with blond hair curling a little
stiffly above a pretty, somewhat lined and care-worn
face. She dressed well. There was no
hint of vulgarity or display, but a considerable
amount of grace in the simple silk dress she
wore, and the soft folds of the gauze fichu
knotted at the breast.</p>

<p>The little tea-table drawn up to the fire was
dainty too. It was covered by a simple linen
cloth trimmed with lace, and the doily that
lay in the cake-basket was fine in texture and
white as snow.</p>

<p>“You go in for <i>afternoon</i> tea, I see,” said her
sister, with the faintest touch of sarcasm in her
voice. “Quite fashionable.” She put her cup
to her lips, and drank off its contents at one
gulp, as she spoke, as a sort of protest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Yes, I like it. I think it’s a pretty fashion.
Why shouldn’t I have it, if I want to? Of
course ’Enry says it’s a ‘lot of tomfoolery,’
but that don’t matter to me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan occasionally dropped an <i>h</i>, but her
voice was clear and musical like her daughter’s.</p>

<p>“Besides, with Bridget coming home and all,
I want to have things nice for her. She’ll look
for it.”</p>

<p>“When do you expect ’er?”</p>

<p>“In about an hour,” Mrs. Ruan said, glancing
at the clock, her face brightening. “There!
I <i>’ave</i> been looking forward to her coming home.
I’ve missed ’er dreadfully,—that I ’ave; but of
course I <i>had</i> to think of her education. ’Enry
was <i>always</i> against this school, you know,—grumbled
at the expense an’ all; but I was
<i>determined</i> she should go and have good
schooling.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wainright grunted a little.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that ’Enry wasn’t right,” she
said. “I always thought it was a mistake
myself.”</p>

<p>“A <i>mistake</i>,” her sister echoed indignantly.
Her face flushed. “But there, Jinny, you never
<i>did</i> have a spark of ambition for your children.
Now, I <i>have</i>, and it’s harder for me than for
you, p’rhaps,” she added wistfully. “Of course
I wouldn’t own it to any one else, but a sister’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
different. There’s no doubt about it, a public
house <i>is</i> looked down on. It’s a fine paying
thing, of course, an’ I can’t say a word against
it; that’s where all the bread and butter has
come from. But people don’t like it. And if
I hadn’t always ’eld my head up, we should
never have known the people we do. We should
have had to be content with the Browns—you
know—that greengrocer lot, and the Witleys—the
tobacconists, and that kind. But I never
<i>would</i> know them, and now we <i>do</i> go to the
Jenkinses sometimes, and the Wilbys, and the
Walkers. Not that, between you and me, I
think the Jenkinses are any superior to us.
Old Jenkins isn’t a bit refined, to my taste, but
they’ve got a nice genteel business, and they’re
well thought of in the town, and of course that
makes a difference.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know your own affairs, I s’pose,”
returned her sister; “but <i>my</i> opinion ain’t
altered. The girl will come ’ome with ’er ’ed
choke full of ’igh and mighty ideas, an’ you
won’t find she’s goin’ to be satisfied with the
Jenkinses—<i>nor</i> the Wilbys, for that matter,
neither. Unfitting a girl for ’er station in life,
I call all this education. My Bessie and Janey
shall never ’ave it—I’ll see to that.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” broke in Mrs. Ruan eagerly, ignoring
the latter part of the speech; “but I look higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
for Bid than the Wilbys or Jenkinses even.
She’ll meet <i>their</i> friends of course, and be <i>fit</i>
to meet them now after being at school all
these years. Why, young Spiller, that young
fellow in Bailey’s Bank, and Downs, he’s a
clerk in Hobson’s office, and Danby, they all
visit the Jenkinses. I daresay they laugh at
them behind their back,” she continued, as
though stating an obvious possibility, “but
they <i>go</i>. Bid will marry one of them, I expect,
and then she’ll be out of trade altogether.”</p>

<p>“Much better if she stopped in,” Mrs. Wainright
said with a sniff. “She’d get a chance of
a comfortable ’ome with a nice young publican.
Don’t talk to me about yer tuppenny-’apenny
clerks.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan drew herself up. “That was
always like you, Jinny, always looking out for
the main chance. As for me, I’d sooner ’ave
my girl married to a man with a nice genteel
occupation than have so much money. Besides,
all these young fellers have expectations,” she
added inconsequently.</p>

<p>“Well, mark my words, you’ll ’ave a time
with ’er,” replied Mrs. Wainright. “The child’s
been away from you all these years, except fer
the ’olidays; and <i>then</i> you’ve generally sent ’er
into the country because of ’er ’ealth, or something.
Why, you hardly know ’er. You don’t
know what she’s like to live with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Bid’s all right,” her mother said confidently.
“A more affectionate child you wouldn’t meet
with in a day’s march. I own she’s a bit queer
sometimes,” she went on slowly, after a moment’s
pause, “and she’s got a temper—that’s not to be
denied. She’s got mother’s temper, as well as
her looks,” she added, “and ’er sharp tongue
too.”</p>

<p>“’Ave you got that old picture of mother as a
girl?” asked Mrs. Wainright presently. “I
’aven’t seen it for years.”</p>

<p>“Yes, here.” Mrs. Ruan rose and went to a
desk under the gilt-legged table at the other end
of the room. She unlocked it, and, searching
among the papers, presently took out something
with which she returned to the fire. “I’ll
light the gas,” she said; “it’s quite dusk—you
can’t see.”</p>

<p>The gas-jet flared up, and Mrs. Wainright
turned the sketch to the light.</p>

<p>It was the head of a fisher girl. A gray kerchief
was tied over her curling hair, and a
coarse gray peasant’s frock, open carelessly at
the neck, was just indicated. The girl’s face
was beautiful; there was a touch of dignity
about it that was even more arresting than its
beauty. On the back of the sketch was scribbled,
“Bridget O’Hea,” and a few almost
illegible words in French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“What does that mean?” she asked her
sister.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Father saw it in one of those
artist-men’s sketch-books, and wanted to buy
it, I’ve heard mother say; but ’e gave it to
him—said he had plenty more of her.”</p>

<p>“Bridget’s the very image of her, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes—might be ’er daughter. She don’t
favor either you or ’Enry a bit,” Mrs. Wainright
declared.</p>

<p>“Do you remember when we were little, running
about barefoot on the shore at Dara’s Bay?”
asked her sister presently in a low voice, glancing
over her shoulder to see that the door was
shut; “and mother telling us stories over the
peat fire in the evenings—an’ singing. What
queer outlandish things she told us, do you
remember?—and the things she sung. Sometimes
I ’ave the air running in my head for days
now, and I can see her great big eyes when she
told the stories to us children—just like Bid’s.
Do you remember the painter-folk that hung
about the cottage? Mother used to wear a scarlet
shawl, and sit on that bit of old wall by the
sea—didn’t she?—and knit. Can’t you see
her now? And the artists that used to come and
talk to her? She always made them laugh, I
mind me.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Who’d think, to see us sittin’ in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
drawing-rooms now, we’d come out of that
little wood shanty?” Mrs. Wainright replied.
“But I don’t know that we weren’t ’appy
enough.”</p>

<p>“Bridget came across this picture one day,
when she was a little thing,” Mrs. Ruan resumed
after a pause, locking the sketch away in the
desk again, “and she asked who it was, and I
told ’er it was her grandmother, but she was
never to tell a word about ’er being only a fisher
girl. And what do you think she said?—that’s
what I mean by Bridget being <i>queer</i>. She said
she’d much rather be a fisher girl and live in a
hut by the sea than keep a public house. I
smacked her for it—silly little thing.—She
ought to be here by this time.</p>

<p>“Oh, here’s father!” Mr. Ruan was a
thick-set, rather powerfully built man, with a
somewhat florid complexion, and a taciturn
manner.</p>

<p>“Room’s very ’ot,” he remarked, shaking
hands with his sister-in-law. “Bridget not
come yet?”</p>

<p>“No, she’ll be here in a few minutes. I
didn’t go to meet her because Jinny came in.
There! that’s the cab, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She ran to the top of the stairs, but Bridget
was already half way up.</p>

<p>“Well, mother!” she cried gayly, flinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
herself into her arms. “Here I am!—the train
was awfully late. How are you, father? oh!
and Aunt Jinny.”</p>

<p>She entered the room with her arm round her
mother’s waist, kissing her between the words,
over and over again. The maid came in with
fresh tea, and she sank into a low chair by the
fire, pulling off her gloves, and chattering.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan glanced triumphantly at her sister,
and then back again at Bridget.</p>

<p>“Child! how you’ve grown!” she exclaimed,
with a glance at the girl’s slight, erect figure
and bright eyes.</p>

<p>“So I ought,” Bridget cried. “I’m eighteen.
<i>Eighteen!</i> Aunt Jinny, what do you think
of that? Lovely tea, mother—oh! and hot
cakes!—<i>delicious!</i>”</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Wainright rose to go. Mr.
Ruan accompanied her to the front door, and
his wife left the room to give an order to the
maid about the luggage.</p>

<p>Bridget was left alone for a few minutes.</p>

<p>She glanced round the room, and the light
went out of her eyes. She heard her father’s
gruff voice in the passage downstairs. “Tell
that idiot of a maid of yours to take these boxes
out of the way!” he shouted irritably.</p>

<p>The color flamed in the girl’s cheeks. She
rose from her seat, and went slowly to the fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
and knelt before it. She saw the red glow of
the coals through a blinding haze of tears.</p>

<p>In a flash, as it seemed, the full significance
of her home-coming was revealed to her.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she whispered, “what a wicked girl I
am! I’m glad to see mother, but—I—<i>don’t
want to come home</i>. I didn’t know it would be
as bad as this.— What shall I do? What <i>shall</i>
I do?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“An invitation for the Jenkinses—for the
14th,” Mrs. Ruan said, triumphantly, coming
into the dining-room one morning.</p>

<p>Bridget sat at the table writing. She had
been home about three months. Mr. Ruan,
who had not yet gone to business, lay back in
his arm-chair before the fire, with the paper.
His coat hung over the back of the chair; he
usually preferred to sit in his shirt-sleeves
when he was off duty.</p>

<p>Bridget looked up. She frowned a little,
began to speak, and was silent, biting the end
of her pen.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” Mrs. Ruan’s voice
changed at once into an irritable, complaining
key. “You don’t want to go, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to go?—why not?” exclaimed
Mr. Ruan, looking up from his paper. “Aren’t
the Jenkinses good enough for her? You don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
seem to ’ave made so many friends at school,
my girl; so if you’re not invited away to stay
with swells, you must put up with the people
’ere, or go without.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I didn’t want to go,” Bridget
replied, turning away her head.</p>

<p>“Didn’t <i>say</i>. Of course not; it’s your
<i>manner</i>,” retorted her mother. “I thought
you’d come back more fit to ornament society,
<i>that</i> I did,” she said bitterly. “Instead of
which you seem to care for no gayeties like
other girls—nothing but those everlasting
books. I’m sure—”</p>

<p>“That ’ull do, mother,” her husband broke
in, raising his voice. “She’ll go—that’s all
about it—and take some music, can’t you?” he
added angrily, turning to Bridget, “and let them
see you can play. Hang it all! I expect old
Joe Jenkins is laughing in his sleeve, to think
of all the money I’ve spent on you. A ’undred
and twenty a year! and what’s the good of it?”</p>

<p>Bridget sprang to her feet, and with reckless
haste began sweeping all her papers together.</p>

<p>“<i>Do</i> let’s talk about something else!” she
cried, with sudden passion.</p>

<p>“Why haven’t any of your school-fellows
asked you to their homes?” inquired her mother,
querulously. “I daresay you were stupid enough
to tell them who we are, and <i>that’s</i> why.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“That is just the reason!” Bridget exclaimed,
closing her lips tightly.</p>

<p>“Well!—of all—”</p>

<p>But Bridget had reached the open door.
She ran upstairs to her room, and shut herself
in.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan waited till she heard the bedroom
door shut, and then broke into helpless tears.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Jenkins party was at its height. The
plush-covered chairs were all pushed back
against the wall, leaving a sea of crimson carpet
exposed, in the midst of which, like a solitary
black island, stood a tall hat, into which Mr.
Jenkins was endeavoring to throw cards. On
the marble-topped chiffonier, in front of a
glass-covered statuette of a fat little girl with
an emaciated lamb, and a little boy in a white
parian sailor suit teaching a dog to beg, there
were plates of nuts, half oranges, and apples
cut into quarters.</p>

<p>The light from the glass chandelier, with all
its dangling irresponsible pendants, streamed
down upon the kneeling form of Mr. Jenkins,
and brilliantly illuminated the scene. A group
of young men, among whom were a few girls in
a chronic state of giggle, stood behind their
host, applauding his skill, or making rash boasts
about the brilliance shortly to be observed in
their own performances, when he should have
resigned his place. The rest of the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
sat round the room on the plush-covered chairs.
Most of the young men had congregated on one
side, and the girls on the other.</p>

<p>Only two or three of the men were in evening
dress. The girls for the most part wore much
starched summer muslins, high at the neck and
long in the sleeves. Some of them had put on
their winter best gowns, and attempted to give
the “evening” touch by bows of heliotrope or
pink chiffon, light gloves, and hair bound with
a colored ribbon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins, a fat comfortable lady in black
silk, with an écru lace cap, sat in an arm-chair,
alternately beaming upon the young people
and applauding “papa’s” lucky shots.</p>

<p>“Carrie, dear, won’t you give us a song?”
she begged presently. “That pretty new one
of yours—what is it? I never <i>can</i> remember.”</p>

<p>“Oh, lor, ma! How many times am I to tell
you it’s as old as the hills! She means ‘Queen
of my Heart,’” said Carrie, turning to the girl
next her. “Every one’s sick and tired of it, of
course, but pa likes it.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear, it’s always <i>sweet</i>. I love
it. It reminds me of that darling Haydn Coffin.
Isn’t he a dear? Isn’t he <i>handsome</i>? My!
Susie and I did make fools of ourselves over
him the first time we saw him. Do sing it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Carrie. I’ll shut my eyes and <i>dream</i> of him,”
she cried in a tone of chastened sorrow, though
her smile was cheerful. She was a plump girl,
with green plush sleeves, and a Swiss belt
covered with coffee lace.</p>

<p>Carrie rose to look for her music.</p>

<p>“Allow <i>me</i>,” said one of the young men,
crossing the room in a great hurry. Mr. Spiller
was tall and pale, with a facetious expression
and sandy hair. He was a great wit, and whenever
he said, “Allow <i>me</i>,” or “May I offer you
any refreshment?” the girls giggled.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spiller, how absurd you are! You’re
killing,” Carrie murmured, with laughter.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” observed Mr. Spiller, with
truth. “Always delighted to wait on the
ladies, I’m sure. Little dears! we all love
them.”</p>

<p>“Rude man,” said Carrie, shaking out her
skirts, and pushing the music-stool backwards
and forwards.</p>

<p>Mr. Spiller’s gallantry did not carry him far
enough to turn over the leaves of the song. He
presently strolled away, and walked leisurely in
front of the rank of chairs on the girls’ side of
the room, with his hands in his pockets. Some
of them nudged each other as he passed, and
giggled.</p>

<p>“Doesn’ he fancy himself—just,” observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Mary Wilby. “But he’s handsome, don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t he divine!” whispered her friend.
“I b’lieve he’s going to talk to Miss Ruan.
Yes,” with a sigh, “he is.”</p>

<p>“<i>She</i> fancies herself, if you like. I believe
she’s <i>awfully</i> stuck-up—really; despises us, I
shouldn’t wonder, for all she’s pleasant enough
when you meet her.”</p>

<p>“Stuck up! what’s she got to be stuck-up
about? Why, her father’s only a publican. I
must say I wonder at Mrs. Jenkins knowing the
Ruans. Nice shop and all as they’ve got, and
so well up as you might say they are. I hate
public-house people myself. It’s such a <i>low</i>
business. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but she doesn’t look much as though
she belonged to one, does she? Queer-looking
girl. Do you think she’s pretty?”</p>

<p>“No—much too strange-looking for my taste.
I suppose we’re not good enough for her after
her boarding-school people. She’s never made
any friends since she came home. I don’t know
her at all—don’t want to either; but Nellie
Clarke says she went in there one day, and
couldn’t get on with her a bit. She was polite
enough, but Nellie says she couldn’t understand
her; she didn’t seem to care for anything—not
the church even, nor Mr. Millar, and he’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
best-looking of the curates. Anyway, Nellie
couldn’t do with her at all.”</p>

<p>“Look at her,” urged Mary, nudging her friend
again. “She’s hardly answering Charley Downs.
Don’t you hate that way she has of looking on
the carpet?—so indifferent; though I shouldn’t
wonder if it wasn’t to show off her eyelashes. I
believe she can hardly keep a sneer off her face.”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t surely have the cheek to sneer
at Charley Downs. Surely <i>he’s</i> good enough
for her. Why, he’s in Bailey’s Bank, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bless you, she wants a duke! What a
dress, too. I think it’s downright affectation
to come in a dress as plain as that. Just to make
herself look different from us. She knew all the
girls would likely wear their summer muslins.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully well made, though; and that bit
of lace is good, you can see.”</p>

<p>“So it ought to be. They’ve plenty of
money—must have, or her dad couldn’t have
sent her to a swell school.”</p>

<p>The conversation, to which “Queen of my
Heart” had made an excellent accompaniment,
was broken off by the inevitable high note with
which all of Carrie’s songs ended.</p>

<p>“<i>Thank</i> you, dear!” both girls exclaimed,
in haste and simultaneously. “We <i>have</i> enjoyed
it so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Carrie, my girl, let’s have something to
eat,” shouted Mr. Jenkins, who had persistently
aimed cards at the hat throughout the song,
accompanied by loud exclamations at intervals
of “Got ’im!” “Boss shot!” “Try another!”</p>

<p>“Here, you young folks! Can’t enjoy yourselves
on an empty stomach, you know. All
nonsense.”</p>

<p>“<i>Pa!</i>” exclaimed Carrie, with annoyance.
“How stupid you are!”</p>

<p>“Stupid, my dear, I may be; faint, I <i>am</i>.
When’s supper, mother? Oh my! look at ’em
frowning! Said something I oughtn’t to, ’ave
I? Can’t help it. Food’s the main thing in
life, eh? What do you say, all of you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins trotted about with a plate of
ginger-nuts in one hand, and one of quartered
apples in the other, talking cheerfully to the
company at large.</p>

<p>“Now, young men, make yourselves useful.
Wait on the ladies.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, the youths dashed at the
chiffonier, where they jostled one another for
the green dessert plates.</p>

<p>“Have a nut, Miss Ruan,” implored Mr.
Spiller, returning to her side. “So sustaining.
Not one? Won’t you share one with
me now?” he whispered facetiously, bending
towards her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>The girl drew back proudly. There was no
mistaking the gesture.</p>

<p>“That girl of Ruan’s is too big for her boots,
as the saying is,” whispered Mrs. Jenkins to a
friend.</p>

<p>“Is she? She’s quiet, I noticed, but she’s
pleasant mannered enough, I thought.”</p>

<p>“Look at ’er with young Spiller. I don’t
call <i>that</i> pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s offended her,” Mrs. Walker
returned comfortably. “Young men nowadays
are very free, I fancy. When I was young—”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. Why, most girls like a bit of
chaff. I’ve no patience with stuck-up rubbish
like that.”</p>

<p>“Now, you girls and boys,” called Mr.
Jenkins’s voice, drowning the buzz of talk and
laughter, and clatter of plates, “what do you
say to <i>kiss-in-the-ring</i>! There’ll be just time
for a good game before supper, eh, missus?”</p>

<p>Some of the girls furtively tossed their heads.
“So common,” one or two murmured.</p>

<p>“We’re delighted, sir, of course,” drawled
Mr. Spiller, superciliously, “but what about
the fair sex? Kiss-in-the-ring is a little out of
date, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“All nonsense, my boy!” answered Mr.
Jenkins, cheerfully, bustling people about to
form the ring. “Kissing ain’t out of fashion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
whatever else is, I’ll be bound; and the girls
like it right enough, for all their screaming and
<i>don’t</i>-ing. A very good game. I like it myself,
at <i>my</i> age. Don’t let the missus ’ear that,
though,” he added in a stage whisper, with a
wink. “Now, Miss Ruan, my dear, come
along. There’s a young gentleman at your
right hand that’s anxious to begin, <i>I</i> know.
Headache? Nonsense! it’ll take it away.
Won’t you, really?”</p>

<p>“There! she won’t play,” announced Mrs.
Jenkins, as Bridget passed her to find a seat on
the opposite side of the room, out of the way of
the ring. “Not proper, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Walker followed the girl with her eyes.
“Beautiful girl, I call her. How well she
moves!” she said.</p>

<p>“I’d rather have your Louisa or my Carrie,”
Mrs. Jenkins returned with asperity. “An outlandish
looking girl, I say—and proud as Lucifer,
I’ll be bound. What for, I should like to
know? My ’usband always <i>would</i> know Tom
Ruan; he’s a very old friend, else, as far as
I’m concerned, I draw the line at publicans.
One must draw it <i>somewhere</i>.”</p>

<p>“It’s her schooling,” replied Mrs. Walker.
“I’ve heard she’s clever. I daresay she’d put
my Louie or Lizzie in the shade at her books,”
she added, laughing comfortably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Well, what if she can?” Mrs. Jenkins
returned. “What’s the good of it? A girl
doesn’t get married any sooner for so much
book-learning. The men don’t care about it,
my dear. What they want’s a girl that can
keep house and cook a bit, and make the children’s
clothes. If she’s pretty, so much the
better. Men will be men, of course.” Mrs.
Jenkins laughed leniently, and shook her cap
roguishly at Mrs. Walker, so that all the sequins
on it clattered.</p>

<p>“There’s Carrie gone to talk to her,” she
went on. “I suppose she thinks she looks out
of it. Well, and it’s ’er own fault if she does.
Her mother was always a stuck-up madam.
There she is, over there. Looks young still,
doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>Bridget sat on a blue plush sofa, working her
heel savagely into the carpet. Her heart was
still beating angrily in spite of a desire to
laugh, which was inextricably mingled with a
sense of shame.</p>

<p>“You came—you shouldn’t have come if you
can’t have the decency not to ‘behave superior,’”
she found herself repeating monotonously.</p>

<p>With an effort, she pulled herself together,
and turned smiling to Carrie, moving her skirt
a little to make room for her.</p>

<p>“You don’t care for kiss-in-the-ring, ducky?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Carrie began effusively. “No more do I. I
think it’s <i>common</i>, don’t you? I think a girl
oughtn’t to let herself be kissed by anybody—only
her beau. Have you got a beau?” she
inquired confidentially.</p>

<p>“A bow?” asked Bridget, with a momentary
puzzled frown. “Oh I see! No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you set your cap at one of the
gentlemen here?” Carrie whispered. “Mr.
Spiller, now. He’s good-looking, isn’t he?
and I’m sure he’s awfully gone on you. You’ve
mashed him awfully.”</p>

<p>Bridget involuntarily drew her dress a little
closer to her, and straightened herself. Then
she resolutely turned to the girl again.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” she answered vaguely,
laughing a little.</p>

<p>“Now, missus, I ain’t goin’ to wait a minute
longer for my supper. Come along, you young
folks. Take your ladies, young gentlemen,
and follow me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins seized the plump girl with the
green sleeves, tucked her hand under his arm,
and pranced out of the room into the oil-cloth
covered landing. There was much confusion
and a babel of tongues, as the couples filed after
him. Bridget saw Mr. Spiller coming towards
her, and shrank hopelessly in her corner.</p>

<p>“There! I told you so, ducky,” whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Carrie, as she took the arm of her acknowledged
beau. “He’s awfully gone.”</p>

<p>“Are you engaged, Miss Ruan. Pardon me—I
did not mean <i>permanently</i>—though for <i>my</i>
sake I hope not. But may I?—will you favor
me?—supper?”</p>

<p>Bridget set her teeth, and rose in silence.</p>

<p>Supper was spread in the breakfast-room next
to the kitchen. The somewhat dark narrow
staircase which led to it afforded an opportunity
for a good deal of whispering and giggling
before the last step was reached. Bridget had
dropped the young man’s arm almost immediately,
on pretence of gathering up her dress,
and her left hand hung at her side. Mr.
Spiller’s hand crept towards it. They had just
reached the bottom step. Bridget turned her
head, and gave him a lightning-swift glance, and
his hand dropped instantly as though it had been
stung. He flushed, and stumbled in the narrow
passage before the door was reached.</p>

<p>They were the last couple, and as they entered
the room Bridget saw with relief that there was
only room for the ladies at the table. The men
stood behind their partners’ chairs, unscrewing
bottles of ale and stout, or handing plates of
chicken. One or two of them paused a moment
with a vague sense of admiration as the girl
walked up the room, head erect, to where Carrie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
was energetically patting a chair next to her
own.</p>

<p>“Come here, dear. I’ve kept a place for
you. Mr. Spiller, give Miss Ruan some bottled
ale, and look after her, you naughty man!”</p>

<p>“By Jove! she’s a stunner,” whispered Wilby
junior to young Jenkins. “What eyes she’s
got, eh? and hair! I’m a bit spoony, Jim.
Let’s try and cut Spiller out.”</p>

<p>“Done,” returned Jenkins, with emphasis.
“I’ll have first go. Give me that plate of
tongue.”</p>

<p>“Let me give you some tongue, Miss Ruan,”
he implored, elbowing Spiller aside, as he stood
sulkily in the background.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he whispered, as he put the
plate down in front of her. “Spiller’s had too
long innings by a good bit. Give some other
feller a chance, won’t you, Miss Ruan? We’re
goin’ to have dancin’ after supper. May I have
the first valse? Come now.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I don’t dance,” murmured
Bridget, untruthfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, that’s playin’ it too low
down upon a chap,” Jenkins returned, ruefully
retreating.</p>

<p>“Have some jelly, Miss Ruan?” said Wilby
junior’s voice at her ear, through the babel of
laughter and clattering of plates. “You’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
have some to please <i>me</i> now, won’t you?” he
murmured in wheedling tones.</p>

<p>“Harry’s quite a lady’s man, isn’t he,
ducky?” said Carrie, in an audible whisper on
the other side. “You’ve mashed him too, I
declare.”</p>

<p>“She’s quite right, though she needn’t shout
so loud,” Mr. Wilby murmured, reluctantly removing
the plate of jelly. “I shall <i>take</i> the
first waltz after supper,” he added fiercely, with
a Corsair-like change of tone.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear,” said Mr. Jenkins heartily,
bustling round to Bridget. “You’re eating
nothin’, <i>I</i> can see. Bless these young fellers,
they ain’t ’arf up to the mark, not a patch on
the young men forty years ago. <i>They’d</i> ’ave
looked after you fast enough. You’ve got some
footin’ on the light fantastic before you, remember,
and young girls ain’t kep’ up on nothing,
though they <i>do</i> try to make us believe it, eh?</p>

<p>“No puddin’? Nonsense!” He cut a huge
slice of tipsy cake, and bundled it unceremoniously
on to her plate. “There! you won’t taste
anythin’ much better nor that in a ’urry. My
missus’s make. Ain’t it, missus?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Ruans’ cab came at twelve o’clock.
Bridget followed her mother downstairs with a
white fleecy shawl over her head. She looked
pale and tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>Mr. Jenkins was in the passage leading to the
front door, shaking hands heartily with the
departing guests, and shouting last words to
them as they drove away.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Mary, my dear,” he cried,
pinching Mary’s red cheek. “When are you
goin’ to git married, eh? Must look sharp
about it, you know. Keep the young men up
to the mark. They’re cautious nowadays,—they’re
cautious,” he repeated gleefully, rubbing
his hands. “’Ullo, Ruan! You off? Glad to
have seen you, old boy, and your missus, and the
young lady,” he added, with a mock serious bow
to Bridget. “She’s a bit quiet, Tom. Ain’t
you, miss?—but none the worse for that, p’raps.
You know what they say about the quiet ones,
my dear? Ha! ha! Eh, Tom? Eh? You’ll
have her flying away from the nest before you
know where you are, p’raps, eh?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins shook hands a little stiffly with
the mother and daughter, but Carrie made up
for her lack of cordiality by kissing Bridget
effusively on both cheeks.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, ducky, you <i>don’t</i> mind giving me
the pattern of that lace collar, do you?”—“I
call her <i>lovely</i>!” she exclaimed with honest
admiration as the cab drove off.</p>

<p>“And <i>I</i> call her a stuck-up little minx,” her
mother said sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“And why you couldn’t have made yourself
agreeable to that young Spiller passes my comprehension,”
Mrs. Ruan said in an irritable voice
half an hour later. Her husband had risen to
go upstairs to bed, but he paused at the door to
listen to her words. Bridget lay back wearily
in her chair. Her cheeks were flushed with
annoyance, her eyes big and bright with tears.
In the light of the gas burner overhead her hair
glittered like threads of gold. The sight of the
girl’s beauty, as she glanced at her, angered her
mother still further. “She’ll throw away all
her chances in spite of it,” she thought resentfully.</p>

<p>“Mother, I <i>couldn’t</i>,” she answered with fierce
emphasis. “The man’s not a gentleman. I—”</p>

<p>“Not a gentleman!” interrupted her father.
“Not a <i>gentleman</i>, indeed! And pray what do
you call a gentleman? And you a publican’s
daughter. P’raps you’ve forgotten it. <i>’E hasn’t</i>,
you may take your oath. Don’t talk to me. You
make me <i>sick</i> with your nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>want</i> to talk, I never want to talk
about it, but you drag me into these discussions,”
Bridget cried hopelessly. “I’m not
talking about social position,—that isn’t what
I mean.” She paused, and then moved restlessly
in her chair.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she said, turning to her appealingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
“don’t let us discuss these things so much.
We <i>never</i> understand one another, and it leads to
so much unhappiness.” Her voice trembled.</p>

<p>“Unhappiness! Yes, you may very well say
so,” repeated Mrs. Ruan, sobbing.</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for you to sit there and
cry,” broke in her husband furiously. “Who
badgered me from morning till night about this
girl’s education, eh? If only you’d listened to
me, we wouldn’t ’ave had any of this ’umbug.
I suppose she’s got some new-fangled ideas
into ’er ’ed, that it isn’t necessary or becoming
nowadays to please the men. But I’ll tell yer
what it is, my girl,” he continued, turning to
Bridget, “unless you want to be a miserable
old maid you’ll ’ave to brisk up, and not be so
stand-off. What men like is a nice bright girl
that’ll listen to ’em with a smilin’ face, that
can rattle off a bit of lively music to cheer them
up when they’re dull. I don’t mean the sort of
rubbish <i>you</i> play, but—”</p>

<p>“Father, I’ve told you often that I learnt
quite a different sort of music at school. I
can’t help it that Mr. Jenkins doesn’t like
classical music. You sent me to school, and
now you’re vexed because—”</p>

<p>Her angry voice broke again miserably, as
she recognized the utter futility of arguing the
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Yes, I did, and a fool I was for my pains.
Precious little good it’s done you. There you
sat like a stick the ’ole evening, till I was
<i>ashamed</i> of you, and—” Mr. Ruan left the
room, banging the door, without completing
the sentence.</p>

<p>“And such a nice party as it was, and every
one ready to be agreeable to you; that Mr.
Spiller, and young Wilby, and all,” her mother
said between her tears.</p>

<p>Bridget rose abruptly. “Oh, yes. I was
rude and hateful, I know,” she began wildly,
“but—there! Why do we talk about it? Good-night,
mother.” She bent towards her, but
the elder woman put out a hand to keep her
away.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to kiss me. If you think
yourself above the Spillers and the Jenkinses,
<i>I’m</i> not good enough for you. Me and your
father are common, of course. I wonder you’re
not too much of a fine lady to live with us.”</p>

<p>“I wish to Heaven I didn’t!” cried the girl
in a half strangled voice. She gathered her
cloak over her arm, and left the room hurriedly,
choking a sob.</p>

<p>She stumbled on the shiny oil-cloth covered
stairs, blinded by her tears. A glimmer of gas
lighted the narrow landing at the top of the
second flight. Bridget pushed open the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
on the right, and entered her own room. Her
hand trembled as she raised it to turn the gas
higher. She sank down on a chair before the
dressing-table, and, burying her face in her hands,
sobbed aloud. Presently she rose, impatiently,
and began to pace the room, clenching her
hands angrily, her tears drying on her flushed
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Why should I care,” she thought incoherently.
“It’s as unjust as it can be. They
first send me to live with ladies, and then
expect me to tolerate the Spillers and the
Jenkinses of their acquaintance. To have no
friends but people like these! no talk but their
talk, about their sweethearts, and ‘divine men,’
and their Sunday hats! To submit to be
‘spooned with’ by these abominable young
men—to <i>marry</i> one of them perhaps! Oh, I
can’t, I <i>can’t</i> wear out my life like this!” she
whispered in a sort of frenzy of despair. “Such
a long life—” She sat down on the edge of
her little white bed, her hands tightly clasped
in her lap. In fancy the long gray years passed
over her in endless procession, bringing the ever
recurring household routine, the same profitless
heart-breaking scenes with her parents, the
same listless dressing for hateful parties, and
preparations for still more hateful ones at
home. A shudder shook her from head to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
foot; she rose swiftly in horror, and began to
undress.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she whispered, “it <i>can’t</i> be like
that. I won’t have it. It’s <i>my</i> life. I’ll make
something better of it than that. There are
people I should like—people who would like
me—somewhere. I will find them. I will go.
<i>Somehow</i> I will get away. I will teach. Some
day”—she threw up her head determinedly—“I
will write—but first I must have life—experience.
Oh! I know that it will take a long
time, but I will do it! The thing is to get away.
I must think, I must plan.” She had taken
the hair-pins out of her hair, and pushed the
brushes and trays aside to make room for her
elbows on the dressing-table. Her eyes were
dry, and bright with hope and excitement. She
thrust her slender fingers through the thick
hair that fell round her face and neck, while
her thoughts whirled. “There will be a row
with father, of course, but I shall get my way.
I will go to London. Helen will help me to
get work, and in my spare time I can write.”
Brilliant, intangible ideas for stories began to
take shape and float through her brain. Why,
even this evening’s experience, remembered in
London, would be glorious—as copy. She
smiled a little, and then began to laugh softly.
A phrase or two which indicated Mr. Spiller’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
facetiously tender side-glance, and Mr. Wilby’s
struggles with an aspirate, rose to her lips.
“How splendid they would be—in a story!”
The word brought her suddenly, with a shock,
to actualities. “Yes, but I live amongst them,”
she cried, as though to some listener. “To
outsiders, to people who belong to the upper
classes, they are funny, they are types,—they
speak of them with amusement, as though they
were curious animals, whose habits and customs
they had been clever enough to observe. But I
<i>live</i> with them, I belong to them. What right
have I to satirize them? It’s an impertinence,
disloyal—they are my people. I belong to
them. Why, mother thinks they are above
me!”</p>

<p>The thought of her mother, of her angry
reproachful words half an hour ago, brought
back her misery in a flood. She always shrank
from allowing herself to analyze her feeling
for her father; but for her mother—that was
different.</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered over the little room. She
looked at the frilled curtains her mother had
hemmed, at the valance round her bed, at the
lace-edged covers on the dressing-table and
chest of drawers, at the numberless trifles about
the room, all of them dainty and pretty. Mrs.
Ruan had the feminine graceful touch commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
supposed to be the peculiar monopoly of women
of a higher class. She glanced from one thing
to another, and as she looked her eyes filled
again with tears. Her mother had spent so
many hours making her room pretty before she
came home from school! A portrait of her stood
on one side of the dressing-table. Bridget took
it up, and looked long at it. Even in the photograph,
the querulous lines round the pretty, weak
mouth were strongly indicated. But Bridget
only saw her <i>mother’s</i> face. As she gazed, hundreds
of little nursery scenes flashed through
her mind. She remembered coming in from a
walk once, long ago, crying with cold. She
saw her mother running towards her with pitying,
caressing exclamations. “<i>Mother’s poor
little girl! Was she cold and miserable? Let
mother warm her!</i>” She felt once more the
delicious sense of warmth and protection as
she lay cuddled in her lap, her little bare feet
wrapped in the warm flannel apron. She remembered
her mother’s heart-broken tears the first
time she went to school.</p>

<p>“But she’ll come home such a little lady,
won’t she, father?” she had said with a pitiful
smile and trembling lips, as Bridget had clung
to her, crying too.</p>

<p>She turned the photograph over, and read
with tear-dimmed eyes the words on the back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
“<i>Mother’s love to her dear little Bid.</i>” It was
the photograph she had sent her the first term
at school.</p>

<p>Bridget threw it down with a sob.</p>

<p>“Poor mother! poor mother!” she wailed.
She rose impulsively and opened her door. The
light downstairs was out. All was darkness
opposite, where her mother slept, and she closed
the door, with the added misery of being in
some way again repulsed. She undressed mechanically,
her tears falling all the time. “Poor
mother! She must be so disappointed! It’s
all so different from what she expected. I
understand how she feels. And yet how can I
help it? We haven’t a thought or a pleasure in
common; but we love one another, and that
makes it so difficult, so impossible to go, so
unbearable to stay. And it’s nobody’s fault—that’s
the worst of it. Oh, if we were only not
fond of each other, how much simpler it would
be!” She turned out the gas, crept shivering
into bed, and buried her face in the pillow, sobbing
miserably. In the opposite room her
mother lay, crying quietly lest her husband
should wake, but not less bitterly.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days later, Bridget found a letter for her
on the breakfast table. It was from Helen
Mansfield, and as she read it her eyes brightened.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she cried rapturously, “Helen
wants me to go and stay with her—next week.
How lovely!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan paused in the act of pouring out a
cup of tea. Her face brightened too.</p>

<p>“Well, what about your dresses, will they
do? They’re grand folks, I suppose, plenty of
money, ’aven’t they? Pa, Bid will want a few
things. You’d better give ’er some money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruan emerged from behind his paper.</p>

<p>“She’ll ’ave to make a five-pun note do, then.
’Ard times, nowadays,” he mumbled, with his
mouth full of buttered toast.</p>

<p>“Oh! but the Mansfields are quite poor
people, I know,” said Bridget. “They live
very quietly. I sha’n’t want a lot of grand
frocks.”</p>

<p>Her mother’s face clouded. She pushed
Bridget’s cup of tea irritably towards her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“I never in my life met such a girl as you!”
she said. “You go to an expensive school
enough, Heaven knows, and the only friends you
make are a miserable, poverty-stricken crew
that are no good to you. You’ll never get a
’usband as long as you live, and serves you
right. You’ve got no more gumption than a
baby. I’m sick and tired of it all.”</p>

<p>Bridget’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“A <i>husband</i>!” she echoed scornfully. “Do
you think that I’m always thinking and scheming
for <i>that</i>, like that awful Wilby girl? It’s
<i>disgusting</i>, I consider.”</p>

<p>“That awful Wilby girl ’ud get married five
times over, before you!” retorted her mother,
angrily. “<i>She</i> knows how to make herself
agreeable, an’ that’s what the men like.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care twopence what ‘the men’ like,”
Bridget broke out fiercely. “<i>I</i> don’t like ‘the
men,’ and that’s what matters to me. Did I
come into the world to consider the taste of Mr.
Jenkins or Mr. Wilby, do you think?”</p>

<p>“You came into the world to make me
wretched, that’s all <i>I</i> know,” replied Mrs.
Ruan, scraping her chair back from the table,
and rising as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Sit down, mother, an’ don’t trouble your ’ed
about that fool of a girl,” Mr. Ruan exclaimed,
dashing down his paper into the butter-dish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
“These ’igh-falutin’ ways don’t suit your mother
or I,—so now I tell yer,” he continued, turning
angrily to Bridget, “’usband or no ’usband, if
you can’t make yourself pleasant at ’ome, you’d
better clear out of it. Go an’ be an old maid
somewhere else, that’s my advice to you.”</p>

<p>Bridget stood up slowly, trembling from head
to foot. She clenched her hands, and she spoke
with a great effort, forcing herself to utter the
words quietly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said, her great eyes blazing,
“I’ll take you at your word. I <i>will</i> go.”</p>

<p>She moved proudly from her seat to the door
and closed it behind her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan burst into tears.</p>

<p>“’Enry, she <i>will</i>!” she exclaimed wildly.</p>

<p>“Let ’er!” shouted Mr. Ruan. “<i>Damn</i> the
girl. I’m sick of this. Who’s <i>she</i>, I should
like to know? If we ain’t good enough for ’er,
let ’er go and find them that is. Bring me my
boots, Mary, an’ look sharp about it. Confound
the women, say I. A man might ’ave a decently
comfortable life without ’em. As it is, I’m
glad to get out of the ’ouse.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Professor Mansfield’s little flat was in the
neighborhood of the British Museum.</p>

<p>The drawing-room, overlooking a formal
square, was filled with the scent of violets the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
evening Bridget arrived. She sat after dinner
in a low chair, in the rosy glow of the fire,
deliciously conscious of the subtle flower-scents,
of the play of light and shade on the books
lining the low shelves round the walls, of the
flash of orange or dainty pink out of the shadows,
as the light glanced on a curtain or a rose-filled
bowl.</p>

<p>Helen was at the piano, playing softly. On
the opposite side of the fire the Professor lay
back in his reading-chair, gently tapping the
tips of his long fingers together in time to the
melody. At his side his sister sat, with a mass
of soft white wool in her lap, her wooden knitting
needles clicking softly now and again.
The Professor and his sister were both somewhat
elderly people. Dr. Mansfield was forty
before he married the young wife who died at
Helen’s birth, and Miss Mansfield, who was two
or three years his senior, had lived with him
since Helen was a baby. Bridget glanced at
them both every now and again. She noticed
the Professor’s broad forehead, the masses of
whitening hair above it, his keen eyes, and thin,
humorous mouth.</p>

<p>A picture of her father’s face as he sat, pipe
in hand, with a sporting paper in one hand and
a glass of grog at his elbow, rose to her mind
for a second in vivid contrast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>She hurriedly put it from her, with a sudden
shamed, disloyal feeling that translated itself
in a frown and an involuntary gesture of repudiation.
The Professor’s quick eyes noted the
movement, and his thoughts wandered from the
music to speculate upon its cause.</p>

<p>Helen rose from the piano a minute later,
and came forward into the firelight.</p>

<p>“The room has one of its pretty moods to-day,
hasn’t it, father?” she said, glancing about
her, as she settled herself on the low curb before
the hearth, close to the Professor’s chair.</p>

<p>“Don’t you notice that rooms have their pretty
days just as people do, Bid?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I believe every day is a pretty day for this
room,” Bridget returned, with a contented sigh.
“It’s sweet. Oh, and the <i>books</i>!”</p>

<p>Her lap was full of volumes, which she turned
over with eager fingers, as she spoke.</p>

<p>“What is this? Keats! how delicious!—in
this dear little volume, I mean. They have
such a hideous edition at the Free Library.
Oh, Helen! and this charming Herrick with
the dainty green and gold cover! And what’s
this? George Meredith—Oh! a poem? Well,
I tried to read <i>Richard Feverel</i>—that’s his,
isn’t it?—the other day, but I didn’t like it
much. I couldn’t understand what he was talking
about,—what he <i>meant</i>, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The Professor laughed a little.</p>

<p>“How old are you, Miss Bridget?” he asked,
with an amused smile. “Eighteen? Well—read
‘Richard Feverel’ again when you are five-and-twenty.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bridget, earnestly, raising her
eyes. They were big and bright with excitement.
“I’ll remember; but perhaps I shan’t
care for novels then. I shall be so awfully
old.”</p>

<p>The Professor laughed again. “What a delicious
thing it is to be so awfully young!” he
said. “Helen, light the lamps, my dear. Miss
Bridget can’t see our slender stock of books
properly by this light.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you <i>mind</i> my turning them over
so?” she asked, deprecatingly. “It’s such a
treat to see so <i>many</i>. I feel excited at just
looking at their covers.” There was a little
tremor in her voice as she laughed.</p>

<p>“I see you touch them as a miser touches
gold,” he returned. “Rilchester is not a good
place for books, then?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a good place for anything,” Bridget
began, impetuously, and checked herself. “No,
I can’t get many books,” she added, in a
studiedly quiet tone.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Bridget fluttered the
leaves of the book of verse she held, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
smoothed the cover gently, with a caressing
touch, before she put it down.</p>

<p>Miss Mansfield had left the room a moment
or two before to give an order to the servant,
and Helen was busy with the lamps.</p>

<p>“May I look at the books on the shelves?”
Bridget said, rising as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Certainly, you insatiable young woman,”
returned the Professor.</p>

<p>He watched her with an amused, critical air,
as she moved lightly from one shelf to the
other, reading titles, opening a volume here and
there to glance at the frontispiece, stopping to
read half a page now and again.</p>

<p>“Like a half-starved child in a pastry-cook’s
shop,” he thought, as he followed her movements.</p>

<p>“What have you found there?” he asked at
last. The girl was bending over one of the books
longer than usual, and he caught a glimpse of
her absorbed face from where he sat.</p>

<p>“It’s an essay,—about Christ; whether he
was God,” she said, glancing at him brightly.</p>

<p>“Ah,—h’m!” observed the Professor, with an
incipient smile of amusement. “That’s not a
book for the young person.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not a young person, and this is
just the sort of book I want,” Bridget replied
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“But the Bible tells you so,” objected the
Professor, mildly.</p>

<p>She turned, looked at him fixedly a moment,
and then laughed. Bridget was charming when
she laughed. The Professor involuntarily joined
her.</p>

<p>“What I say is quite correct, nevertheless,”
he added.</p>

<p>“Of course; but I want to know why I should
believe what the Bible says.”</p>

<p>“Curiouser and curiouser,” he murmured,
raising his eyes to the ceiling. “Where do the
young people of the present day get their ideas,
I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Well, chiefly from books like yours, I think,”
she returned demurely. “I read your ‘<i>Veritas</i>’
a year ago.”</p>

<p>“Verily my sin has found me out!” he
exclaimed. “Well, and at what conclusion have
you arrived?”</p>

<p>“I think,” she said slowly, “that it’s impossible
to tell whether there is or is not a God.
If there is, I’m sure of one thing, He’s not the
<i>Bible</i> God.”</p>

<p>“Why, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Well, for many reasons, but chiefly because
it’s so unjust to call people into the world
without asking if they want to come, and then
by way of adding insult to injury to tell them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
directly they get here, that if they don’t believe
that a man who lived thousands of years ago
was God, they shall go to hell.”</p>

<p>“Bid!” said Helen, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“But that is exactly what Christians are
invited to believe,” she returned.</p>

<p>The Professor was silent. He looked at
Bridget attentively, without speaking for some
moments.</p>

<p>“Where did you learn that? Who has talked
to you about these things?” he said at last.</p>

<p>“No one,” Bridget answered; “I thought
them myself, after the Scripture lessons at
school.”</p>

<p>“Happy and successful teachers!” he murmured
ironically. “That being the case, Miss
Bid, may I presume to inquire what is your
philosophy of life?”</p>

<p>There was a touch of earnestness under the
lightness of his tone, to which the girl immediately
responded.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” she replied with a deep
breath.</p>

<p>She crossed the room slowly, as if in
thought, and came and stood gravely before
the fire, holding out her hands mechanically to
the blaze.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she repeated. “It’s so puzzling.
If it could be so, I think—as we’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
only <i>sure</i> of this life—that we ought to make
the best of it. Use it in the way our natures
prompt us to use it, don’t you? I mean we
oughtn’t to be afraid to be <i>ourselves</i>, not to let
people and opinions hinder us. That’s what
<i>ought</i> to be. But it <i>can’t</i> be, often,” she added
bitterly. “We have affections, we love people
who have nothing in common with us. It’s a
great bother, but it is so. Often I wish I
didn’t, that I might <i>take</i> my own way, lead my
own life, be myself. But one can’t, one can’t.
It wouldn’t be <i>you</i>, after all, if you trampled
other people under foot, and yet how they
hinder you, how they—” she paused, trembling a
little, and flushing.</p>

<p>“Ibsen has surely not arrived at the Rilchester
Free Library, has he?” the Professor inquired.</p>

<p>“Ibsen?” she repeated. “Who is Ibsen? I
never heard of him.”</p>

<p>“You will,” he said. “Seven years hence,
you will probably be in the thick of a fight that
has already begun, Miss Bridget. But to return
to our muttons. What do you want to do?
What would you do if you could? Is it Girton?
Newnham? Medical student, or hospital
nurse?”</p>

<p>“Neither of those things, I think. Certainly
not Girton or Newnham. I don’t know why,
but I’m not drawn to that idea. I want—<i>life</i>;—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
know how things go on in the world
amongst men and women. I want the <i>whole</i>
world, not the set of High School girls to whom
life means the mathematical tripos. I want to
know the men and women who travel, who
write books, who think things, who are interesting—”</p>

<p>“To be in the movement, in fact?” said the
Professor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she responded with an eager gesture;
“that’s what I mean, but I didn’t know how to
say it.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence. The flames sang
a quick, murmuring little song, leaping round
the coals as they whispered together. The
warm, scented room was full of firelight and
dancing shadows. Bridget stood in her soft
gray gown, with one little foot on the fender,
resting the tips of her fingers on the high
white mantel-shelf. Ruddy lights and wavering
shadows chased one another over her slender
figure from head to foot, and played in her
thick, curling hair, and lighted up her big,
serious eyes.</p>

<p>Helen opened the door suddenly, and re-entered
the room, followed by a tall man.</p>

<p>“Here’s Mr. Stevens, father,” she said.</p>

<p>The Professor rose hastily. “Stevens! Really
you? Delighted!” he exclaimed with cordiality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Then after a word or two, “Let me present you
to Miss Ruan.”</p>

<p>Bridget put out her hand, blushing a little
nervously.</p>

<p>“Here’s a man who would be deeply grateful
if half the people who at present ‘think things,’
and write books about the things they’ve
thought, would refrain. He protests by holding
them up to public scorn in the papers, you
know,” he said.</p>

<p>Stevens laughed, and Bridget raised her eyes
and gave him a quick, searching look, full of
curiosity and interest. The two men fell into
talk, in which the girls did not join, but the
editor was conscious that they had an absorbed
listener in one of them, as she sat quietly in
her low chair before the fire opposite.</p>

<p>Helen took her friend off to her own room half
an hour later. “We sha’n’t come back, father,”
she said, as she passed him. “We’re going to
try on frocks, and that will take us till bedtime.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>“That’s a striking-looking girl,” said Stevens,
when the door closed. “She’ll be beautiful, if
I’m not mistaken, when she’s older.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the poor child has brains, moreover,
which makes things ten times worse,—complicates
the case.”</p>

<p>“Worse?” he repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“She’s one of the curious developments for
which this very remarkable end of the century
is responsible. Would you have conceived it
possible that that girl should be the daughter of
a publican, for instance? A man who does all
the roaring trade there is to do, in a god-forsaken
place like Rilchester. But she <i>is</i>. Moreover,
she’s a lady in tastes and instincts, down
to the tips of her fingers. She’s an individualist
by nature,—not the spurious, second-hand
article manufactured out of badly digested Ibsen.
She’s refreshingly ignorant of books at present;
but she has <i>thought</i>, at <i>her</i> age.”</p>

<p>“And she walks like a princess already, and
has imperial eyes,” Stevens added, smiling.
“Curious.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she represents a large class,” the Professor
returned, “though she happens to be a
striking example.</p>

<p>“Poor child! I’m sorry for her. Did it ever
occur to you, Stevens, what a girl like that
must suffer? Our class barriers are but imperfectly
broken down after all. She stands
between two hostile classes,—by education and
by nature she belongs to one, by birth and
social position to the other. She has strong
sympathies with both, but belongs wholly to
neither. Her parents, poor souls, have probably
denied themselves and striven strenuously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
to give her a ‘splendid education,’ thinking
that in some mysterious fashion it will be
good for her. When she returns to them, there
is a great gulf fixed. Her tastes, her sympathies,
her ideals, are not theirs, never can be
theirs. <i>They</i> are hurt, <i>she</i> is hurt. It is inevitable.
It is that saddest, most hopeless thing
in life, ‘nobody’s fault.’ The girl is made to
feel a traitor, disloyal, supercilious, at every
turn, because things in the home life jar,—are
distasteful to her. She hates herself, yet chafes
at the hindrances in her path. The parents look
on, uncomprehending, irritated and irritating,—disappointed,
of course. And it is all inevitable,
irrevocable, part of the movement.”</p>

<p>“This girl’s life is a case in point, you
think?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She has revealed a good deal of it to
me this evening. Oh! unconsciously. She’s
as proud as Lucifer, of course. But I read
between the lines, and Helen has talked to me
about her sometimes. They were at school
together.”</p>

<p>“You think it would have been a happier
thing for her if she’d gone to some academy at
Rilchester for a few years, with the other tradespeople’s
children, and subsequently been given
in marriage to a first-class grocer, who kept his
provision-cart?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“No, not in this girl’s case,” Dr. Mansfield
replied decidedly. “She’s too clever. She
would have carved her own path eventually in
spite of everything. She would have been
fretted to death by the petty routine of a third-class
day-school, and that would have been an
additional burden.</p>

<p>“No, she’s had a start in life, of course,
though a very little one. She’ll go through
great tribulation—she’s just the sort. But,
nevertheless, the trivial round, the common task
was always out of the question for Bridget
Ruan, so she must take what the gods send
her, and if I’m not mistaken, she’ll take it
unflinchingly.”</p>

<p>“She interests you, evidently,” Stevens said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I own it. Perhaps she’ll interest you
too, one day, professionally. Helen says she
writes stories. I wonder what they’re like. I
imagine them crude to the last degree, and
almost as clever.”</p>

<p>“I should like to look at them.”</p>

<p>“Well, ask her. She’ll be overcome with
shyness, but she’ll let you see them. She
wants to stop in London. I must see what I
can do for her.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. “By the way,” the Professor
asked suddenly, “what of that article of
yours on bimetallism? I saw some account of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in the <i>Chronicle</i> to-day.” Stevens replied, and
the conversation drifted into other channels.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Bridget returned to Rilchester at the end of
a fortnight, full of hope and vague, tremulous
excitement. To Dr. Mansfield she had confided
her intention of fitting herself to earn her own
living. She had finally decided to prepare herself
for teaching in a public school; and the
Professor, on mentally reviewing the possible
occupations open to women, had decided that she
had probably chosen the most human of them.</p>

<p>“And I wouldn’t say that to every one,” he
remarked with a smile. “I’ve met one or two
High School teachers in my time,” he paused.
“But I don’t think you’ll easily become an
Instruction-machine, my dear; and as far as I
can judge, human beings <i>ought</i> to be more inspiring
than an office table, and long envelopes
and halfpenny stamps.</p>

<p>“But you have a climb before you,” he added,
glancing a little pitifully at the girl; “and it
must be a steady one,—no spurts, you know;
and—well, the view from the mountain top
may not be so very inspiring after all. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say, that I can’t <i>breathe</i> in the valley!”
Bridget replied.</p>

<p>The Professor looked at her a moment in
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Well, try it,” he said. “At least you will
be better able to ‘possess your soul;’ that is
something.”</p>

<p>“It is <i>everything</i>,” she returned eagerly.</p>

<p>The Professor smiled.</p>

<p>“Leave to possess your soul will seem a very
tame affair in a year or two, I fear,” he said, his
smile fading a little sadly. “But, who knows?
Don’t let the writing go to the wall.”</p>

<p>Bridget gave a little low, excited laugh.</p>

<p>“No, <i>no</i>. How <i>can</i> I, now? If Mr. Stevens
is only right!—but I can’t depend on that, of
course. I must learn to earn my living in some
other way, in <i>case</i>—” She paused, as though
unwilling to finish the sentence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the evening of the day Bridget left the
Mansfields the Professor sat silent for some
time, looking into the fire.</p>

<p>“That child is rather on my mind, Charlotte,”
he said at last. “Have I done right, I wonder?
One shudders when one realizes the frightful
isolation that a life like the one she is bent
upon means for a girl.”</p>

<p>His sister looked up from her work placidly.</p>

<p>“That’s so like you, James, with your theories
about <i>lives</i> and <i>careers</i>, and so on. How can
you possibly know anything about the sort of
life that’s in store for Bridget Ruan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“One observes, my dear,” returned her
brother, mildly. “The High School mistress
lives in lodgings—often alone. She is obliged
to live in lodgings, because she must be within
reasonable distance of the school in which she
teaches, and possibly there’s no boarding-house,
or ‘family desirous of meeting with an
amiable young lady,’ near enough to make any
other mode of life practicable. She is often
compelled to live alone, either because the
other mistresses in the school have already
paired off, or, as may very well happen, because
she doesn’t care sufficiently for any of them
to be willing to share a room or rooms with
them.”</p>

<p>“Bridget ought not to be allowed to live
alone,” Miss Mansfield said decidedly. “She’s
too pretty, too attractive altogether.”</p>

<p>“My dear Charlotte, one does not say to the
New Woman, thou shalt not. It’s too late in
the day. She holds the reins.”</p>

<p>“And drives a great deal too fast,” observed
his sister, dryly, “downhill, too, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“That may be; but you and I sit too far back
to put on the brake, even if we felt alarmed at
the pace. For my own part, I’m not alarmed.
I have faith in the driver. In any case, we
needn’t shake our heads over the recklessness
of the young woman teacher who lives in furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
apartments. Poor soul! she doesn’t
impress me with the idea that she knows much
of the <i>joie de vivre</i>. Do you remember Alice
Evans?”</p>

<p>“But, my dear James, Alice Evans was thirty-five
if she was an hour. You can’t compare her
case with Bridget Ruan’s.”</p>

<p>“Yet she was young once. She’d been
teaching, and had lived in furnished apartments
twelve years before we knew her, if you recollect.
Poor woman! And she looked as though
all the grayness of those twelve years had
slowly gathered in her face.”</p>

<p>There was silence, while the Professor bent
forward and stirred the fire into a blaze.</p>

<p>“Bridget,” he said, leaning back in his arm-chair
again, “Bridget will live in lodgings.
Girls of her class are unaccustomed to the
British chaperon. It will not occur to her
mother that a chaperon is required. I wonder
if it will occur to her to give the girl such
instruction as may fit her for leading an independent,
solitary life? I doubt it. I imagine
her a poor, feckless body. But you will see to
that, Charlotte?”</p>

<p>“My dear James, she’s got all her examinations
to pass yet, and then there’s a school to
be found—no easy matter nowadays, I should
imagine. It will be two years before these preliminaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
are over. The girl may never come
to live in London at all. She’ll probably get
sick and tired of studying alone, and she’ll
marry or something. Why trouble about it?”</p>

<p>“She’ll write in time; of that there’s very
little doubt,” said the Professor, musingly.
“Stevens was very much impressed with the
few things she showed him. But she’ll have to
go through the mill, I think. Hers will be no
cheap success; and then success is a strange,
elusive thing. At all events, <i>if</i> she comes we
can look after her a little, Charlotte. If Helen
is as devoted then as now, there won’t be much
difficulty about <i>that</i>,” he added.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But two years later, when Bridget was teaching
at the Fairfax School near Hackney, the
little flat in College Street was closed. The
Mansfields were abroad. Helen was delicate,
and the physicians had advised a year’s travel.
They had been to Egypt, and were then in the
south of France.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Saturday morning. Bridget was awakened
by the sound of the rain beating heavily
against the windows of her room. From where
she lay she could see a neglected slip of back-garden,
which seemed to exist solely for the
purpose of providing a convenient area for an
avenue of clothes-props, terminating ineffectively
at the point where the steeply-sloping
roofs of the opposite buildings touched the top
of the garden wall.</p>

<p>Streams of water poured continuously over
the roofs, and ran in dirty streaks down the
whitewashed wall. The quick falling drops
made a dreary splashing on the tiles of the yard
below the bedroom window. Bridget surveyed
the inspiring prospect miserably. Her half
awakened thoughts connected it with her yesterday’s
geography lesson to the Second Form.
“Look at the streams of water running down a
roof, the next time it rains,” she found herself
repeating; and then she stirred restlessly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
“I’m in the groove already. Lessons on the
brain!”</p>

<p>She turned her eyes resolutely from the
window, and they began to wander over the
dull lodging-house bedroom.</p>

<p>There was a high mahogany chest of drawers
opposite the bed, its top concealed by a crocheted
cover in coarse cotton, of doubtful whiteness.
Above it hung a picture of a lady with a crinoline,
a pink tarlatan dress, and long ringlets,
her head drooping at the appropriate angle for
stroking the inevitable dove.</p>

<p>Curtains of cretonne, with a hopeless design
in crimson on a drab ground, hung in a corner
of the room over a row of dress pegs. In the
fireplace there was a paper screen, representing
a sylvan landscape ornamented with swans.</p>

<p>The dressing-table was adorned by several
woolly mats of a violent green shade; and on
the mantel-piece there was a row of mourning
cards with chaste designs of silver urns, willows,
and weeping angels. Bridget gazed at them all
with weary indifference. “What am I to do with
this day, and to-morrow, and Monday? Three
whole days to be passed between this room and
the next, if it rains like this all the time,—and
it probably will. At least there are the children
on working days. I wish there were <i>no</i> holidays.
When you’re working you can’t think.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
The sole use of Saturday and Sunday, as far as
I can see, is to make one glad of Monday. It
seems an expensive way of forcing one to
recognize the blessings of employment.”</p>

<p>She rose listlessly from her little narrow bed.</p>

<p>“I must begin the day some time, I suppose,”
she said, half aloud, as she twisted up her
loosened hair before the glass, “though why, I
don’t know. There’s absolutely no point in
it.”</p>

<p>All the time she was dressing the monotonous
drip, drip, drip of the rain made a tearful
accompaniment to her gray thoughts.</p>

<p>When she was ready, she opened her bedroom
door, and entered the room next to it facing the
stairs. She rang the bell, and sat down in the
bow window to wait for breakfast.</p>

<p>The cloth was already laid on a round table
in the middle of the room. It was much too
long, and touched the floor all round. A plated
cruet, with most of the plate worn off, stood in
the middle of the table. There was a cracked
teapot-stand near the edge, behind which a
thick glass sugar basin and one white cup and
saucer stood sentinel. A crooked knife and
one yellow fork were disposed at opposite angles
at some little distance from the solitary teacup.</p>

<p>Bridget glanced drearily at these appetizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
preparations for breakfast, then at the empty
grate, and shivered. It was early autumn, and
Mrs. Fowler hadn’t begun fires yet. A paper
fan covered with bunches of aggressively yellow
primroses stood in the fender.</p>

<p>The sound of panting on the stairs, and a
sharp blow on the door, caused by its violent
contact with the bacon dish, announced the
approach of Matilda, the grimy little “general.”
She came in, holding a plate surmounted by a
rattling dish-cover in one hand, and in the
other a tarnished teapot. These she set on the
table, incidentally spilling most of the bacon
fat as she did so. She then shambled towards
the door, where she stood looking back over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Anythin’ more yer want, Miss?”</p>

<p>“Bread, please, Matilda, and mustard. Oh!
and you’ve forgotten the butter again,” Bridget
said, a trifle huskily, coming to the table.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you please, Missus says there ain’t
no more butter. You ’ad the last with yer tea
last night.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t Mrs. Fowler tell me before?
But it doesn’t matter,” Bridget added hastily,
beginning to pour out the tea. She bent a little
lower over the teapot than was altogether necessary.
Matilda closed the door by means of the
primitively ingenious fashion of dragging it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
after her with one foot, the process requiring
such a curve of leg as to reveal the gaping holes
in her stockings.</p>

<p>Bridget poured some milk out of the cracked
jug into her tea, with a shaking hand, and raised
the cup half way to her lips. Then she put it
down with a sudden rattle into the saucer. Her
tears choked her. She pushed away her plate,
with the dried-up piece of bacon upon it, rested
her elbows on the corner of the table, and
covered her face with both hands. For a minute
or two her tears fell fast, then she raised herself
with a hasty movement, and pushed her hair
back from her face impatiently. “What a fool
you are to cry like a baby, at your age, because
you are dull!” she said to herself. “Did you
suppose you were going to have a wildly exciting
time as a teacher? You <i>wanted</i> to teach,—at
least, you wanted to be independent. Well,
you have what you wanted; this <i>is</i> being
independent.”</p>

<p>She glanced round the room, at the gilt looking-glass,
supported by corpulent cupids, at the
marble-topped sideboard, at the rickety table
in the corner, draped by a magenta cloth, on
which at regular intervals the “Pilgrim’s Progress,”
“Fox’s Book of Martyrs,” and Miss
Braddon’s “Vixen” were disposed, and then
she broke into a short, bitter laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>She drank her tea, and kept her eyes discreetly
on her plate, when Matilda re-entered
with the bread.</p>

<p>As soon as the table was cleared after her solitary
meal she dragged a great pile of exercise-books
from the cupboard under the sideboard,
and began to correct them, trying to make her
mind work with machine-like precision as she
erased or underscored words with a red pencil.</p>

<p>By eleven o’clock the last book was finished.
Twelve—one—two—still three hours before
dinner.</p>

<p>“Ah, the butter!” It still poured steadily;
but after a moment’s hesitation she decided
to go and fetch it. Anything was better than
sitting alone, in the chilly parlor, listening to
the drip of the rain.</p>

<p>There would be people in the streets. The
mere thought of speaking to the grocer’s young
man was a relief. Half an hour afterwards, she
returned wet through, with the butter and the
least dirty of the novels from a dingy circulating
library she had discovered. Her landlady, a
thin-lipped, bony woman, with a high color and
a dirty cap, came out into the narrow, oil-clothed
passage at the sound of the opening door, and
eyed her wet waterproof resentfully. “Stand
on the mat, please, Miss, and take it off carefully.
I’ve just scrubbed this passage. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
’adn’t any call to go out sech weather. I’d ’ave
sent Matilda if you’d only waited patiently,”
she observed in a high-pitched, irritable voice.
She seized the shiny mackintosh, down which
sundry streams meandered, and bore it off to
the kitchen, grumbling in an undertone.
“Please to take off your boots ’ere, Miss. I
don’t want the stairs cluttered up,” she turned
at the door to say.</p>

<p>Bridget meekly obeyed, and crept softly
upstairs, feeling like a criminal. Her bedroom,
which she entered to take off her hat,
struck a dreary pang to her heart, as though she
saw its sordid ugliness for the first time. She
hastened out of it into the sitting-room, which
at least was lighter, and first wrapping herself
in the crocheted wool coverlet from the sofa,
after a shivering glance at the vernal decoration
in the fireplace, she resolutely opened her
book. It was <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. The weird,
uncanny atmosphere of the story oppressed her
with a painful fascination. The strange inhuman
characters lived and moved for her.
Catherine’s wailing cry outside in the storm
rang in her ears, and made her tremble with
fear and pity. At the same time she never lost
vivid consciousness of her own surroundings,—of
the cold, gloomy parlor, and the dripping of
the rain on the window sill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>She put the book aside when Matilda came
in with her dinner, feeling completely exhausted.
The blackened mutton-chop was taken out again
half an hour later by the silent little maid,
almost untasted; and now there remained the
afternoon and evening.</p>

<p>Bridget drew the slippery horse-hair arm-chair
up to the window, and leant her head against the
window frame. The little street on to which
she looked had the suburban air characteristic
of thousands of London streets. It was respectable,
and absolutely featureless. She shut her
eyes and her thoughts wandered back over the
past two years. She remembered all the opposition
she had encountered, and conquered,—her
father’s grudging consent to her plans, her
mother’s tears and reproaches. She thought of
all her hours of lonely, unaided study and preparation
for her work, of her days of despair, and
moments of exultation. Well, that was all over
and done with now. She had reached the goal
for which she had striven: she was a High
School teacher, earning eighty pounds a year,
living in furnished apartments in Wentworth
Street, Hackney. Bridget opened her eyes, and
looked all round the room. The impassive,
hideous furniture, the pictures that looked down
on her from the walls, filled her with a kind of
unreasoning, impotent frenzy of despair. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
sprang from her seat and began to walk wildly
from end to end of the narrow room.</p>

<p>“All for this—for <i>this</i>,” she whispered
hoarsely. In the wave of misery that engulfed
her for the moment, everything was black, hateful,
out of proportion. She forgot the real
pleasure her work gave her; the fact that she
was free from the daily, hourly friction of her
home life no longer seemed important,—worth
anything. Her loneliness, the blankness of the
social side of her life, was all her mind had
room for. Her whole nature cried out against
it in hopeless, passionate protest. She longed,
desperately, childishly, for the warm cosiness of
the sitting-room at home, for her mother’s face,
for the feel of her dress. She felt that to sit over
the fire with her and discuss Mary Wilby’s
chances of catching Charlie Downs, would be
bliss, even with the prospect of the inevitable
misunderstanding at the end of half an hour.
She stopped in her hurried pacing of the room
to take her mother’s last letter out of her pocket,
and to read it for the twentieth time with
blinding tears.</p>

<p>“I am, my dearest little Bid, your loving old
mother,” the letter ended, and Bridget put the
paper impetuously to her lips.</p>

<p>“And I hoped so much; I thought, somehow,
life would be so different,” she whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
to herself. “Oh, it’s all <i>wrong</i>,—hateful, unjust!”
She stopped once before the glass, and
looked at herself wistfully.</p>

<p>“What is the use of being pretty?” she cried,
and turned away with a hasty gesture.</p>

<p>“And my writing; I can’t get on with it!
How could any one in this cramped, unnatural
life?” She pulled open a drawer, and flung a
heap of papers upon the table, glancing over a
sheet here and there.</p>

<p>Presently she thrust them back in disgust.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s all bad, foolish, aimless; and
I hoped once—”</p>

<p>She flung herself back in the arm-chair, and
her face grew rigid. “Well, there’s nothing
to be done but to go on living—till I die!” she
thought, with the hopeless finality of youth.</p>

<p>Some twenty minutes later she was startled
by a voice in the passage below, and then by
the sound of a footstep on the stairs.</p>

<p>There was a knock at her door, and she sprang
up.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she called.—“Oh, Miss Miles,
it’s <i>you</i>. How nice of you to come!” She ran
to her, and seized her two hands impulsively.
“Do sit down. Here’s the least uncomfortable
chair, and here’s a cushion for your head. Oh,
there isn’t a footstool. I’m so sorry! You
left your waterproof downstairs, I suppose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Was Mrs. Fowler <i>furious</i>? I’m so <i>glad</i> to see
you.”</p>

<p>Miss Miles sank into the arm-chair a trifle
bewildered. She hardly understood the warmth
of her greeting. A lady not remarkable for
her imaginative qualities, she would have been
surprised and puzzled at the suggestion that
Bridget’s many hours of loneliness in any way
accounted for its fervor.</p>

<p>“I <i>had</i> to go out to get some Cambridge
examination papers I ordered,” she began, “and
as I was passing I thought you might like to
see the new time-table; there are some changes
in it.” She began to unfold a document on
foolscap, as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, never mind,” Bridget returned
with haste. “Let us talk. I feel like
sitting up and beginning to play, now you’ve
come,” she said gayly. “Oh, it’s been ten
thousand ages since yesterday morning. What
have <i>you</i> been doing? <i>I’ve</i> been bored to
death. Two minutes ago I was wondering
whether a fall from this window would be fatal,
but I decided not to try <i>that</i> form, because the
rain might take my hair out of curl, and that is
so unbecoming, you know.”</p>

<p>She spoke in a laughing, tremulous tone,
from which tears were not far removed. Miss
Miles looked at her blankly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“I can’t stop long,” she said. “I haven’t
finished my Euclid lesson for Tuesday, and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, you <i>must</i> stop. <i>Do</i> stop and have tea
with me, and never mind your conscience. You
should really make an effort to get rid of that
conscience of yours, Miss Miles; it must be
awfully in your way!” Bridget said with an air
of concern.</p>

<p>Miss Miles regarded her with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>She was a dumpy little woman, with a broad
round face, near-sighted eyes, and a pursed-up
mouth. She wore square-toed boots, which her
rather short skirt displayed to great advantage.
There was no collar band on her somewhat infantile
gathered bodice. It was finished at the
neck by a turned-over piece of white lace, which
revealed too much of a thick-set neck to be
quite becoming.</p>

<p>“But a conscience is a great safeguard,” she
began, in a tentative, uncertain fashion.</p>

<p>“What is there to be saved from?” inquired
Bridget, recklessly, with a shrug of the shoulders.
“There isn’t much chance for the devil in <i>our</i>
lives, I’m afraid. I wish there was. It would
at least be exciting to yield to temptation! Did
I say <i>yield</i>? I meant, of course, to <i>resist</i>.
How stupid of me! Resist,—yes, <i>resist</i>, that’s
the right word; but the two things are so much
alike, that one confuses the words sometimes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Miss Miles seemed a little dazed.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” she urged. “How can
to <i>resist</i> temptation be like yielding?”</p>

<p>“The same thing by a different name, you
know! One’s a short cut to the other; but I
don’t know which,” Bridget said. “And now
let us talk of something else,” she added
hastily.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t <i>talked</i> at all yet,” Miss
Miles protested, still preserving her earnest,
serious expression.</p>

<p>“You’re just like the Hatter,” Bridget observed;
she sat nonchalantly on the arm of
the sofa, and tapped the floor with one foot.
“‘Have some wine?’ said the Hatter. ‘I
don’t see any wine,’ Alice replied. ‘There
isn’t any,’ said the Hatter.”</p>

<p>Miss Miles half rose from her seat.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean. What
Hatter?”</p>

<p>Bridget laughed.</p>

<p>“Now you look like the March Hare. <i>What</i>
Hatter, indeed? Where have you been educated?
I thought Scripture was taught in every
school.”</p>

<p>Miss Miles managed to reach her feet; but
Bridget sprang up and threw herself upon her.</p>

<p>“No, no, you mustn’t go,” she cried earnestly,
through her laughter. “I’ll be serious; I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
indeed. I’ll even talk about the Ethical Society
if you’ll <i>only</i> stay. I’ll ring for tea. By
ordering it at three, we shall get it at four; and
that is really quick work for Matilda.”</p>

<p>Miss Miles allowed herself to be placed once
more in the arm-chair. She made a great effort
to collect her somewhat disturbed thoughts,
watching Bridget with a sort of dull, uncomprehending
admiration, as she moved about the
room, putting exercise-books away, and pushing
all the ugliest ornaments out of sight.</p>

<p>Presently she drew a chair near her visitor,
and sat down at the table, propping her chin in
the hollow of both hands.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she said suddenly, leaning forward,
“is life here <i>always</i> like this? Does one
pass one’s time forever between the school and
lodgings”—she swept the room with her swift
glance,—“like these?”</p>

<p>Miss Miles started a little, and stared at the
girl blankly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I—I think so,” she stammered. “I
go to lectures sometimes, and to the Ethical
Society. There’s the theatre, of course, when
one can afford it.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been here?” Bridget
asked.</p>

<p>“Six years.”</p>

<p>“<i>Six years!</i>” she echoed, with a long breath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
“Six years of <i>this</i>. How have you borne it?
What have you done with yourself?”</p>

<p>“I have worked. What does the Council
engage us for, but to work?”</p>

<p>Bridget shrank, as though from a blow.
“Worked,” she repeated. “Yes, of course, but—but
life isn’t—can’t be all work,” she
urged pitifully. “Surely—”</p>

<p>“When you have to get different classes
through the Cambridge junior and senior, the
Board examination, and the matriculation in one
year, you will find there isn’t much time for
anything else.”</p>

<p>Bridget looked at her a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“Have you never had a good time?” she asked
at last, softly. “What have you done all your
life? Ah, you won’t think me rude, will you?”
she added hastily. She bent over and touched
her hand gently as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I don’t mind being interviewed,”
said Miss Miles, with an attempt at sprightliness.</p>

<p>“I went to a high school, and got a scholarship
to Girton, and then I went to a training
college, and then I came here.”</p>

<p>Bridget was silent.</p>

<p>“And that has been your life?” she said
gently, after a moment or two. “And have you
enjoyed it?” she asked, fixing her eyes on Miss
Miles’s face intently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Enjoyed it?” she echoed. “I—I don’t
know. I’ve always worked hard, but I’ve been
rewarded, of course. I’ve had several scholarships,
and I’m a successful teacher.” Miss
Miles flushed a little, and moved nervously.</p>

<p>“It is very clever of you,” Bridget murmured.</p>

<p>Miss Miles glanced at her sharply; but she
was gazing thoughtfully out of the window.</p>

<p>“We had relaxation, of course, at Girton.
We often had great fun,” pursued Miss Miles.</p>

<p>“Educational fun; I know it. ‘Women only
admitted,’” Bridget said drearily.</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t <i>want</i> men, I’m sure. We
enjoyed ourselves quite as well without them,”
returned Miss Miles, with some show of spirit.
“Don’t you admit the equality of women with
men, then? Look at Miss Fawcett. Look
at—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to look at any of them,” replied
Bridget, flippantly. “I’ve looked at enough
women in the two months I’ve been here to last
me my natural life. I wish with all my heart
an epidemic of men would break out!”</p>

<p>“Miss Ruan!” cried Miss Miles, deprecatingly,
with a nervous smile.</p>

<p>“I know nothing of life either,” Bridget said
absently. “We’ve been alike in that respect.
But I’ve always wanted it—<i>madly</i>. You
haven’t, it seems?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“I don’t understand. What do you mean by
<i>life</i>?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Bridget answered with a deep breath,
rising restlessly as she spoke. “I don’t know.
People, experience, opportunities,—love, perhaps.”</p>

<p>The elder woman started and reddened. She
glanced apprehensively at Bridget.</p>

<p>“There! you are shocked because I even
mention the word <i>love</i>, and yet, is it a <i>bad</i>
thing? Why shouldn’t I want it? I <i>do</i> want
it!” she cried.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing like <i>work</i> for making one
forget all that sort of thing,” Miss Miles
began.</p>

<p>“But why should I forget it?” Bridget turned
swiftly and faced her. “You don’t understand.
I like my work; but it isn’t all my life.
There’s room for more than that. If one had a
<i>life</i>—a real life outside, with joys and sorrows
of one’s own, one— Because I’m a teacher,
am I to cease to be a woman?” she broke off
passionately.</p>

<p>“You will not be likely to get what you want,
as a teacher,” Miss Miles said slowly, “unless
you know outsiders. Why don’t you join the
Ethical Society?” she asked after a moment.
“I think you want a <i>motive</i>—a purpose—in your
life. You would get to know people too, and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>Bridget made a swift gesture of dissent.</p>

<p>“No, it’s not <i>that</i> set I want,” she replied
with a little smile. “They exasperate me.
Oh, I know they are very good. I daresay they
are nice, but they are so depressing. They all
look as though they have been shipwrecked, and
are clinging desperately to their last raft. No,
no! I’d rather plunge into the sea at once,
and be done with it. Besides, I always want to
say awful things to them,” she added, with a
change of tone and a laugh. “They look deliciously
shockable, and they <i>all</i> have sad,
reproachful eyes.”</p>

<p>The entrance of Matilda with the tea-tray
interrupted Miss Miles’s serious challenge of
the last assertion, and Bridget steadily refused
to return again to the subject.</p>

<p>They talked of time-tables, of the iniquities
of the Third Form, and of the chances of the
Examinations, during tea.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do on Monday?”
Miss Miles said, as she rose to go. Monday
was a holiday in the schools. “Won’t you
come to an extension lecture with me in the
evening?”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I’ve saved half-a-crown, and
I’m going to the Wagner concert,” Bridget
answered smiling, as she shook hands. “Good-bye.
Thank you so much for stopping.” She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
went down to the front door, and waved a farewell
to her from the doorstep. Then she slowly
mounted the stairs again, and re-entered the
sitting-room. The little glow of excitement had
faded from her eyes.</p>

<p>She crossed over to the mantel-piece, and
stood leaning against it for some time, her
head buried on her arm. “What a fool I was
to say anything to her!” she thought bitterly.
“The need of speaking to <i>some one</i> makes me
<i>abject</i>. Oh, it’s awful—<i>awful</i>, to live like this.
I feel as though some one had wrapped me round
in a damp, gray veil.” She shuddered. After a
moment she roused herself, lighted the lamp,
and fetched some needlework from the bedroom.
With this she resolutely employed herself till
ten o’clock, her usual bedtime.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday</span> was another pouring day. Bridget spent
it in solitude. By the time evening came, she was
desperate enough to put on her waterproof, and go
to the nearest church for the sake of seeing some
human beings. It was a Presbyterian church,
dimly lighted, and filled with reeking fog. The
woman who sat on her right, sniffed violently
throughout the lessons, and sang the hymns in
a loud voice with a pronounced cockney accent.</p>

<p>“<i>The strine uprise, of joy and prise: Alleluia!</i>”
Bridget repeated the words after her to
herself over and over again, repressing an hysterical
desire to laugh as she did so. The man
who preached had a monotonous, dreary voice,
and his face looked blurred and indistinct in
the heavy atmosphere. She gathered that the
sermon was on the subject of the Last Judgment.
As she left the pew when the service
was over, her cloak brushed the hymn-book
of her right-hand neighbor from the bench in
front. She stooped at once to pick it up; but
the woman had already pounced upon it. She
turned a sour, disagreeable face towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
girl, and ignored her murmured apology. The
stupid little incident seemed to Bridget the last
drop in her cup of misery. She left the church
struggling with her rising tears, trembling from
head to foot. She was wet through by the time
she reached the house; but she went straight to
her bedroom. The day had been long enough.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When she awoke, the sun was shining, and
she suddenly determined to spend her holiday in
town. With this resolve, she hurried over breakfast,
and by half-past ten, was on the top of an
omnibus, riding towards the West End. The
air was warm and balmy as spring, and the
sunshine filled her with joy. Her spirits rose,
as the omnibus turned into less dreary roads,
and Oxford Street was at last reached. Everything
amused and interested her,—the crowded
pavements, the hurried glimpses of shops, the
hoardings with flaring posters, the chaff of the
cab-drivers and bus conductors.</p>

<p>“Wot yer witin’ for, Jim?” called the driver to
a friend, who, though his bus was full, continued
to sit stolidly, reins in hand. “Got yer number,
ain’t yer? Want one on the whip, I s’pose!”</p>

<p>Bridget laughed aloud, and the driver turned
round to her with a grin of delight. They
passed a small ragged boy presently, sitting on
the edge of the pavement. He turned an impudent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
little face up towards the man, who bent
down, and struck at him playfully with his
whip. The child sprang up with a whoop of
mingled excitement and terror, the huge shoe
he wore slipping off his dirty little foot as he
moved.</p>

<p>“Frightened ’is boot off!” exclaimed the
jubilant driver with a chuckle, and a glance over
his shoulder at his appreciative listener.</p>

<p>Bridget got down at the Circus, and wandered
along Regent Street, stopping to gaze at nearly
every shop. Liberty’s window was in the key
of blue. She stood a long time before it,
entranced, her eyes wandering from one delicious
dreamy shade to another.</p>

<p>The flower-shop she came to soon, was another
ecstasy of color. In imagination she touched
the leaves of the heavy pink roses caressingly,
and smelt the purple violets. Feathery chrysanthemums—tawny,
pink, and white—made
a bower of delight, like the entrance to an
enchanted garden, leading oddly enough out of
the bustling street.</p>

<p>She lunched frugally, at an ærated bread shop,
off a scone and a cup of coffee; and then, because
she was tired with walking, took another omnibus
towards the city.</p>

<p>The roar of the Strand fell pleasantly on her
ears, and filled her with an indefinable excitement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
It was wonderful to be in the midst of all
this teeming life. London was no longer the
cruel, heartless, indifferent city it had seemed
last night. It was alive, full of human pulsation;
she was part of its life—in the heart of things.</p>

<p>From Ludgate Hill she walked past St.
Paul’s, where, before the railed-in churchyard,
she stopped a moment to watch the children
playing amongst heaps of yellowing leaves. She
noticed a flash of white wings against the sky,
as the pigeons wheeled overhead, then settled,
some on the path, some on the grass under the
trees, close to the feet of the children. The
little green oasis in the heart of the city gave
her a thrill of pleasure. She walked on, and
turned into Cheapside, threading her way along
the crowded pavement. The many faces, the roar
of the streets, the jostling crowd, bewildered her,
but it was long before she felt that she was tired.
Then, at last, she slowly retraced her steps, till
she once more reached St. Paul’s churchyard. It
was striking a quarter to four as she passed the
great door of the cathedral. A few people were
going up the steps and entering the building.
Bridget followed them into the gloom of the
church. She walked wearily up the nave, and
sank with a sigh into one of the lines of chairs
placed under the dome. The clear amber gleam
from the long rows of lamps in the choir, mingled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
strangely with the dying fire of the sunset
streaming in through the west windows. The
chancel, thus lighted, had the effect of a great
white flower mystically illumined by an inner
radiance of its own. Bridget lay back in her
chair, too tired to think, dreamily conscious of
its beauty. The white-robed choristers entered
presently, and she sat still with closed eyes
listening to their thrilling voices. There was a
sweet-faced hospital nurse beside her. Bridget
noticed the ebony cross on her breast, and supposed
she was High Church. She watched her
serious, rapt face during the lessons with a sudden
pang of envy.</p>

<p>“I haven’t even the consolation of religion
to help me through,” she thought; and her
desolate mood surged once more around her,
and all the gladness of the morning was gone.</p>

<p>She followed the stream of departing worshippers
after the service, feeling too tired and
dispirited to care much for the thought of the
concert, yet unwilling to return to her rooms
and face the long evening alone.</p>

<p>A cup of tea, which she got at a pastry-cook’s,
took away her headache, however, and she made
her way soon after to Piccadilly. It was very
early; but St. James’s Hall would do to rest in,
and she had nowhere else to go. She paid her
half-crown, and climbed the narrow stone staircase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
into the orchestra, which was almost empty.
She went right up to the top row, where there
was a wall to lean against, and sat down with a
sigh to wait. The hall gradually filled. All
the seats in the rows below Bridget were speedily
taken. She watched each fresh comer with
interest,—strange-faced men, with long hair
and spectacles carrying the <i>score</i>; women with
lank hair and strange gowns, and intense expressions.
One man turned the corner at the head
of the staircase, and stood there a moment,
scanning the well-filled lines with bright, alert
eyes. Bridget watched him a little curiously.
She liked his tall, lithe figure and air of genial
determination. After a moment’s pause, he
began to mount the giant steps between the
rows of seats, making straight for the place at
the back his quick eyes had discovered to be
still vacant. She watched the quiet deliberateness
of his ascent, with amusement, and noticed
that every one made way for him without demur.
The woman next to her moved closer to her
girl friend, as she saw him making for the last
row, and a seat was thus left, next to Bridget.
He took it quietly, putting his hat down on the
floor at his feet, and Bridget resumed her watching
of the new-comers. The orchestra was on
the platform by this time, and the air was full
of the vibration of strings, as the men tuned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
their instruments. The sound, and the buzz of
talk, and the sight of the great lighted hall,
with its swaying sea of faces, excited her. Her
weariness had gone. She sat with eyes alight,
and clasped hands, in breathless expectancy.
Presently a burst of clapping rose from the
stalls, and was taken up by the galleries and
orchestra, till it spread from end to end of the
hall in a great wave of sound. Herr Richter
stood bowing, first towards the body of the hall,
then in the direction of the orchestra. There
was a lull, the sharp click of the baton, a
sudden pause; and then the rocking, breathless
rush and swing of the <i>Walkürenritt</i>. Bridget
sat motionless, her color coming and going, her
heart beating wildly. It was wonderful, thrilling,
almost terrible. She found herself praying
for it to cease, yet dreading to hear the last note.
The magnetism of the vast silent audience
seized her, and set all her pulses vibrating. It
was over. She drew a deep breath as the storm
of applause swept the hall, and leaned back
exhausted, her color fading.</p>

<p>“Here is the programme, if you care to see
it,” the man at her elbow said.</p>

<p>He gave it to her, and she put out a trembling
hand for it. “Thank you,” she said, in a low
tone, bending over it. The man glanced at her
swiftly. He had been watching her through
the <i>Walkürenritt</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“You are a Wagnerite, I see,” he said, as she
returned the programme.</p>

<p>“I never heard any of his music before,”
Bridget answered. Her voice was not firm yet.</p>

<p>“But you like it?”</p>

<p>“I never imagined anything so wonderful, so
<i>awful</i>.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you hear the <i>Siegfried Idyll</i> for
beauty. It comes next. We are too close,
really; but I came here because I wanted to see
Richter conduct. Ah, <i>now</i>!” Once more the
breathless hush fell on the swaying crowd, and
the long, low wail of the violins broke the
silence.</p>

<p>Carey glanced at the girl once, and saw that
the tears were dropping down her cheeks. He
turned his head sharply away. When the
applause died, he turned to her.</p>

<p>“You look very tired,” he said gently. “Are
you alone? Perhaps you ought not to have come.”</p>

<p>Bridget made a great effort for self-control.</p>

<p>“I’m—oh!—I’m quite well, thank you.
It’s so stupid of me,” she said in a shamefaced
voice. “I didn’t know Wagner was like <i>this</i>,
or I wouldn’t have come when I was tired.
I’ve been walking rather far, and—”</p>

<p>“And existing on buns and tea all day, no
doubt,” Carey thought, mentally concluding the
sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>During the remaining part of the concert
Bridget sat silent, and outwardly composed,
though she was very pale. When it was over,
and she rose to go, Carey put out his hand to
help her down the steep steps. As they went
down the stone staircase together in silence, he
noticed that she rested her hand against the
wall now and again, to steady herself.</p>

<p>The light from a lamp in the street outside
fell on her face as they reached the outer door.</p>

<p>Carey hesitated.</p>

<p>“You will let me put you into a cab, won’t
you?” he said. “You ought to get home as
quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no!” Bridget forced herself to say.
“The—the air is so strong, it made me feel
giddy for a moment; but it will be good for me.
I will go home by train.”</p>

<p>The idea of a cab all the way to Wentworth
Street was out of the question—ruinous; but
she felt so shaken that she dreaded the long,
jolting omnibus ride. It would perhaps be
quicker by train.</p>

<p>“But you will have to walk—to Charing
Cross, is it?—and you don’t look fit to do
that.” He paused a moment. “If you really
won’t have a cab, may I walk with you a little
way? I’m going towards Charing Cross, and
you oughtn’t to be alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Bridget glanced at him; he met her look
gravely. There was nothing in his face but
solicitude for her, and she felt too ill and tired
to argue the question.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, moving from the
door; “but you mustn’t go out of your way for
me.”</p>

<p>“Take my arm,” he said gently, looking
down at her white face.</p>

<p>Bridget put up her hand, and laid it on his
arm at once. It was shaking, he felt.</p>

<p>“This comes of a long day’s shopping, and no
lunch!” said Carey, as they turned into Waterloo
Place.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” She looked up at him
a moment, and smiled. “Oh, it’s so <i>stupid</i> of
me! I never felt like this before!” she cried.</p>

<p>“You won’t make me believe you never went
without your lunch before. All women do when
they are left to their own devices; they think
it’s so economical.”</p>

<p>“There’s no denying that it <i>is</i>,” Bridget
replied. The fresh air had revived her already,
and the miserable feeling of faintness was passing
off.</p>

<p>“Oh, until the doctor’s bill comes in, no
doubt. For my part, I’d rather spend half-a-crown
on a glass of claret, and a decent sized
cutlet in the middle of the day, than fourpence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
in an ærated bread shop, and a guinea subsequently
on tonics. But though I spake with
the tongue of men and of angels, I shouldn’t
hope to convince a woman on this point. I
know it’s hopeless.”</p>

<p>Bridget smiled faintly. She wondered for
how long eighty pounds a year would stand
half-a-crown lunches.</p>

<p>“It might have been advisable to bring a
mother, to-night, don’t you think?” he went on
after a moment. “I know a chaperon is a thing
of the past, but employed judiciously and in
moderation she is not without her use—in her
proper place, of course.”</p>

<p>He spoke in a tone of half laughing raillery,
but Bridget’s smile faded.</p>

<p>Involuntarily she withdrew her hand from his
arm.</p>

<p>“I’m not the sort of girl who requires a
chaperon,” she replied coldly. “I’m a High
School teacher. The High School teacher is
used to going about alone. If she wasn’t she
would die of loneliness in her lodgings,” she
added; “and life is sweet even to a teacher.”</p>

<p>There was a ring of bitterness in her voice
which startled him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he began. “It was the stupidest
joke. I didn’t mean to be rude; please believe
me,” he urged. He was conscious of feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
ridiculously eager to put himself right with
her.</p>

<p>“You will forgive me, won’t you? But you
look so young.” His voice had completely lost
the slight tinge of mockery she had resented.</p>

<p>Bridget’s anger died.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel young,” she said, shaking her
head. “I feel as though I’d lived a long
time.”</p>

<p>“You don’t live alone, do you?” he asked.
“Yes?—poor child!” the last words were
almost involuntary.</p>

<p>“And you have no friends in town?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet. My friends are abroad. I
daresay it will be better when they come back;
but I don’t know when they are coming,” she said.</p>

<p>“What a cruel, inhospitable city it is!” he
exclaimed musingly.</p>

<p>“It’s too big; it’s rather frightening sometimes.”</p>

<p>“But—there are other teachers, aren’t there?”
he asked after a moment, turning to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; they are kind enough, and I like
teaching,” she said hastily. “But—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.” Bridget glanced at him;
his eyes met hers with a flash of sympathy,
and her heart beat a little quicker.</p>

<p>“You liked the music to-night, in spite of
being tired?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Oh!” she drew a long breath. “It has
made me alive again.”</p>

<p>“Well, on the whole, it is good to be alive.
Why not come to next Monday’s concert?
You’ll hear <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> then. Magnificent.”</p>

<p>“I oughtn’t to; I shall have piles of books
to correct next Monday, but I <i>will</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do. I shall look out for you. I’m going
to the orchestra again. I shall have to lay in
a stock of Wagner sensations varied enough to
last me some time. While I cross the desert,
and drop leisurely down the Nile, and afterwards,
when I’m in the mysterious East, which,
however, recks not of Wagner.”</p>

<p>“You are going to travel?” Bridget asked.
His words had called up vague pictures of dazzling
skies, of white roofs clear cut against the
blue, of wide horizons, and the glitter of strange
streams. She seemed to look out upon it all
from prison bars.</p>

<p>“Yes, I start for Algiers to-morrow week.
It will be a year or two before I see this city of
dreadful night again, most probably.”</p>

<p>They were in the Strand now. Bridget was
silent as they turned into the station yard.
She was too tired, too oddly dispirited to
reply.</p>

<p>He went with her past one of the swing doors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
up to the booking office, when they reached the
station.</p>

<p>Then she started, as though roused from a
dream. She put out her hand a little shyly.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” she said. “You have
been so kind. Perhaps, then, I shall see you
next Monday?”</p>

<p>“I shall look out for you,” he returned, with a
smile. He turned back at the door to see the
last of her. She had taken her ticket, and he
caught a glimpse of her face as she left the
window. The pose of her head was peculiarly
graceful, he thought. He stood and watched
her a moment till she moved out of sight towards
one of the platforms.</p>

<p>Bridget lay awake long that night. She was
possessed by an unaccountable restlessness and
excitement. The music still surged in her
brain. It had aroused emotions, vague desires
to which she could give no name. It filled her
with gladness to have discovered something outside
herself which responded to, and expressed
some of her wild, chaotic moods.</p>

<p>The thought of the man who had spoken to
her was inextricably woven with her remembrance
of the music. The idea that there was
anything unusual in her walk with him did not
once occur to her. It had happened so; he had
been very kind when he saw she was ill. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
liked his face, and his voice,—his voice especially.
There was so much self-confidence
about it that it made one trust him implicitly.
Then he had “understood.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know a man <i>could</i> understand so
easily,” she thought, with a little thrill. “Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday,—six days before
next Monday. Suppose he isn’t there?” a
blank, desolate feeling followed the thought.
“And he’s going away next day.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following Monday, Bridget woke with
something of the delightful childish feeling that
there was a treat in store. All the time she was
dressing, she sang to herself softly, and during
the History lesson in her own form, she found her
mind wandering frequently from James the First
to St. James’s Hall.</p>

<p>It seemed natural that there should be several
offerings of flowers on her desk that morning. It
was a gala day for her. One of the children
came in late, after the names had been called;
she walked up to the desk with a bunch of violets
in her hand.</p>

<p>“I’m late, Miss Ruan,” she said calmly, presenting
them; “but they hadn’t any flowers at
the corner, so I had to go back.”</p>

<p>Bridget reproved her somewhat perfunctorily,
and fastened the violets in the front of her dress,
whereupon Gladys went to her seat, smiling happily,
and gave in her “late, please,” with cheerful
emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>The room was full when she went into the little
study set apart for the mistresses, at lunch time.
Two or three of the teachers looked up as she
entered.</p>

<p>“Flowers again, Miss Ruan!” one of them
exclaimed. “You get a great many more than
your share.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Ruan!” exclaimed Miss Yarvis,
apologetically. She was a middle-aged lady,
with a worried expression, and spectacles. “I
was <i>obliged</i> to give an order mark in your form
this morning. Beatrice Mandy was so excessively
tiresome that she left me no alternative.
I’m extremely sorry.”</p>

<p>“You speak as though you’d signed a death-warrant!”
said Bridget lightly. “I suppose she
forgot her pencil, or something?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Miss Ruan! Beatrice Mandy?
She’s the trial of my life,” Miss Harding broke
in, volubly. “She’s a <i>dreadful</i> child! I’m
worn out with her,—worn <i>out</i>! Corporal punishment
is the only thing for children like that,
in spite of all the nonsense that—”</p>

<p>“It’s moral <i>influence</i> that is required, Miss
Harding,” interrupted one of the teachers, looking
up from the pile of exercise-books she was
correcting at the middle table.</p>

<p>Miss Harding and Miss Brown did not love
one another, and Miss Brown’s tone sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
indicated the fact. Miss Harding reddened
angrily, and an animated argument on the subject
of personal chastisement <i>versus</i> the ameliorating
influence of the True Teacher (Miss Harding, by
implication, not answering to that description)
was soon in full swing.</p>

<p>“Miss Ruan, have you begun the History for
the Cambridge yet?—because I haven’t; and
how the Third will ever get through it, I don’t
know,” sighed Miss Miles resignedly. “They
know absolutely nothing of the Tudor Period, and
as to the Stuarts—”</p>

<p>Bridget had heard precisely similar remarks at
lunch time for the past three months. To-day
they seemed to her more than ordinarily trivial
and unmeaning. “I wonder if it’s like this in
the real world?” she thought, as she re-entered
her class-room. “All this fuss over trifles; and
the real things—the vital things—always,
always untouched!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At half-past seven, she was climbing the stairs
leading to the orchestra.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’ll be there,” she repeated
to herself at each step. Her eyes sought the
top row of seats, directly she turned the corner,
and brightened instantly.</p>

<p>He met her look, and rose, indicating a seat
next to him, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>They shook hands.</p>

<p>“Well,” he began, as Bridget sat down, glancing
at her; “you’ve had lunch to-day, I see.”</p>

<p>“I not only had lunch, I had an egg for tea!”
she replied, laughing. “Mrs. Fowler, my landlady,
was much surprised, and a little indignant;
but I insisted.”</p>

<p>“But this surpasses my wildest, most daring
dreams of success!” he exclaimed. “I shall
begin to believe that my proper <i>rôle</i> after all, is
to turn missionary to the girls of England, on
the great Food Question.”</p>

<p>“What are they going to play to-night?”
Bridget asked, turning to him. She had loosened
the gray fur at her throat; it fell round her
shoulders, and showed a glimpse of her white,
slender throat above the dark gown she wore.
There was color in her cheeks, and her eyes
were big and bright with excitement.</p>

<p>“The <i>Meistersinger</i> and <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>,”
Carey said, looking at the little waving curls
that fell against her forehead as she bent over the
programme.</p>

<p>He wondered what color her hair was by daylight.
It was red gold where the light caught it
at the upturned edges.</p>

<p>“It seems rather ridiculous that I don’t know
your name yet,” he remarked after a moment.</p>

<p>She raised her head, with the quick movement
he had observed was a trick of hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Yes; so it is!” she said, laughing a little;
“and I don’t know yours either. My name is
Bridget Ruan.”</p>

<p>“Irish?” he asked. “Of course—I see you
are! Oh, I’m forgetting my part of it. My
name’s Carey.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bridget</i> was my grandmother’s name,” she
said. “She was Irish, but she married an Englishman.
They say I’m like her, but I never saw
her; she died before I was born.... And so
you’re starting to-morrow for all the wonderful,
beautiful places in the world? Ah,” with a long
breath, “how I envy you! You will just pass
on from one lovely country to another. It will
be like a royal progress, with all the bother of
royalty left out.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “I shall put in a little work at
intervals, I hope; just to accentuate the joy of
the progress.”</p>

<p>“Work?” she repeated, knitting her brows a
little. “What work?”</p>

<p>“Oh!—writing.”</p>

<p>Bridget turned to him with sudden interest.
“You write?” she said eagerly. “Where?
What sort of things?—do tell me! Novels?”</p>

<p>“No, I never perpetrated a novel. Verses
sometimes, articles, various things. They are
signed ‘L. C.,’” he added.</p>

<p>“Oh,” her face flushed with eagerness, “then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
I know them! I’ve read several of them!” She
paused, there was a thrill of excitement in her
voice. The articles, she remembered, had
charmed her. She had read them many times.
There was about them a rather intoxicating breath
of vitality, a somewhat incongruous, but wholly
charming play of fancy, which had delighted
her. It seemed to her the most intensely interesting
and exciting thing in her experience,
to be actually talking to the man who wrote
them.</p>

<p>“I read <i>The Other Country</i> a week or two ago,”
she began. “I thought it wonderful,” she added
after a moment, looking full at Carey.</p>

<p>There was such evident sincerity in her words
and gesture that his face lit up with sudden
pleasure.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it pleased you,” he said, simply.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Bridget’s face clouded,
and saddened.</p>

<p>The man bent slightly towards her.</p>

<p>“May I know what you are thinking?” he
asked gently,—“or is the question an impertinent
one?”</p>

<p>She started, and blushed a little. “How did
you know? I wish I had the sort of face that
contradicts what one feels! I was thinking how
hard things are for women. I mean, it takes
such a lot of struggling and fighting before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
can get to the point at which men—or most of
them—begin. For instance, I want to write—I
<i>shall</i> write some day, I think,” with a determined
lift of the head; “but oh, if you only knew!”—she
checked herself. “It has been, and will be,
for me, one ceaseless fight with circumstances,”
she went on in a low tone, as though impelled to
speak. “It seems that all one’s best strength is
wasted in raising a little platform for oneself—just
room to stand on and breathe, but quite bare
and empty, when one has at last reached it,” she
added bitterly. “Oh, I know there <i>are</i> women
who start fair; they <i>can</i> have life, be in the
stream, if they wish,—if they want to badly
enough, and have the courage to defy a few
prejudices which are every day getting fewer
and fewer—but it’s maddening to think that
even <i>this</i> depends on all sorts of things outside
oneself—the accident of birth, social position,
money—” she paused. “How egotistical you
must think me; and you are bored, of course,”
she exclaimed, apologetically, with a quick change
of tone. “But—it’s so long, <i>such</i> a long time
since I talked to any one!”</p>

<p>“I am not bored,” he said gravely. “I understand.”</p>

<p>She turned her face, and looked up with gratitude
that touched him.</p>

<p>“That is nice! I wanted to say—if I may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
really grumble and not bore you—that it’s hard
for other people to realize what the life of a
woman who works for a bare living is like—to
some one who wants—oh, <i>everything</i> almost! I
mean, of course, for one like me, who has no
independent social life; and there are hundreds,
hundreds like me!” she went on. “One sees
them, and they grow old, and faded, and uninteresting.
I watch them, and shudder, and think—‘A
few years, and <i>you</i> will be like that, past
everything,—past sensations, emotions, experience!
You won’t ever remember how you once
longed for these things; even your work, which
interests you now, will have grown stale, because
it—’ When these thoughts come, in the night
sometimes, I feel that I shall go mad.” She
spoke in a low, vibrating tone. The last words
were the expression of months of pent-up restlessness
and lonely misery.</p>

<p>Carey was startled by their passionate, despairing
ring.</p>

<p>“I know, I understand,” he began. “But see!
I don’t think it will be like this with you for
long. Will you believe me, seriously? I’m
going to prophesy; but I will do it, presently, as
we go home,” he added.</p>

<p>Bridget smiled. In some mysterious fashion,
she felt that what he said was true. Her heart
began to beat exultantly. It was absurd, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
told herself, the way he had of inspiring
confidence.</p>

<p>Was it merely his voice? she wondered. She
glanced at him to see if the explanation was to
be found in his appearance. She liked the look of
strength about his square jaw, and the air of life,
of strong vitality, which his bright, deep-set gray
eyes gave to his face. A clever face, she thought
gladly.</p>

<p>They talked on indifferent subjects for the ten
minutes or so before the music began, and then
not at all, till the last notes of the <i>Liebestod</i>,
with which the concert ended, died away.</p>

<p>Bridget rose with a long sigh, her eyes still
dreamy with the music.</p>

<p>It was raining fast, as they found when they
reached the open air, and she uttered an exclamation
of dismay, at the discovery. “I didn’t even
bring an umbrella!” she exclaimed tragically.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a cab,” Carey said. “Wait in the
doorway till I get one. I’ll come back for you.”</p>

<p>He was gone before she could protest.</p>

<p>“I was going towards Hackney,” he assured her,
with an unveracious smile, holding his umbrella
over her, as they went down the narrow alley
towards the hansom. He helped her in, gave
the address she resignedly told him to the cabman;
and after the preliminary plunging and
backing, they started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“You shouldn’t!” she began, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“You obviously couldn’t go home without an
umbrella,” he returned calmly; “and the spirit
of prophecy doesn’t descend upon a man more
than once or twice in a lifetime. When it does,
he should <i>always</i> take a hansom.”</p>

<p>“How comfortable!” Bridget exclaimed, settling
herself against the padded back of the cab.
“I’ve never been in a hansom before! Ah, how
beautiful the lights are! See that long line of
lamps reflected in the wet pavement!” She
never forgot this drive,—from Piccadilly to
Wentworth Street. In dreams, sometimes, she
saw long, dark roads, outlined in points of flame,
white smoke rising from the reeking flanks of the
horse, as the lamplight for a moment streamed
full across its path,—shining, wet pavements,
reflecting yellow gleams: all seen through rain-dimmed
glass. In dreams, too, the sound of
Carey’s voice had, as an accompaniment, the
ring of hoofs on the road, and the jingle of
harness.... They talked nearly all the way,
freely, without reserve. Until they reached a
street in the neighborhood of her lodgings, a
street familiar to Bridget, she had forgotten that
he was going, that this was probably their last
meeting. She realized it then all at once, with
painful suddenness. It was like a dreaded parting
with some one dear to her. Carey looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
down at her. She was silent, leaning back
against the cushions, her chin a little lifted.
The lighted lamp overhead threw out her profile
in strong relief against the dark background
of the cab. His eyes rested on her face. It was
pale, and there was a pathetic, tired droop about
her mouth. Her waving hair fell in bewildering
little rings on her white forehead.</p>

<p>He put out his hand with a sudden, impulsive
movement, and withdrew it as hastily.</p>

<p>She did not see the gesture, but the slight
movement made her turn her face towards him.</p>

<p>“You will send me the stories, then,” he said
a little hurriedly. “You won’t forget—to-morrow?
I shall get them in time. You have
the address?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she returned, and then added, “it is
so good of you.”</p>

<p>“Why, to be curious?” he asked lightly. “I
<i>want</i> to see them.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t be disappointed; it’s so
difficult to judge one’s own work, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She felt she was speaking mechanically, for
the sake of saying something. The cab had
turned into Wentworth Street. She could see
the lamp-post just opposite Mrs. Fowler’s house.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said, “and good-bye, and,—thank
you very much.” She put out her hand,
as the cab drew up with a flourish before number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
twenty-five. “I hope you will have a delightful
time,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“I have <i>had</i> a delightful time,” Carey answered,
still holding her hand. “I ought to thank <i>you</i>
for it.” He hesitated, took her other hand as
well for a moment, and then released them both.
“I shall not forget it,” he said, as he helped her
to alight.</p>

<p>She did not ring the bell till the hansom had
turned, and was on its way down the street.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fowler, cross and sleepy, opened the door,
and closed it again with unnecessary vehemence.
“I s’pose you won’t want any supper, Miss!” she
said, as Bridget entered with a weary step.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART II</h2>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h3>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Five</span> years ago since I saw Piccadilly!”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens! it must be—seems hardly
possible!” exclaimed Carey’s friend, Trelawney.</p>

<p>The two men were in a hansom on their way
to Mrs. Edgbaston Smith’s party.</p>

<p>“I can’t think how ever you came to stop away
so long, old man! I should have gone mad; but
then I’m like poor old Ortheris when I’ve been
out of London six months,—‘sick fer the sounds
of ’er, and the sights of ’er, and the stinks of ’er—orange
peel, and hasphalte, an’ gas, and all!’”
He laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” said Carey, with a shrug.
“I meant to come home before, of course,” he
went on after a moment, “and then, when the
poor old man died I felt I never wanted to see
the place again. So I moved on, kept moving,
went to the other end of nowhere. I’ve seen
most things now, that’s why I’m back again.”</p>

<p>“Well! it’s time you <i>were</i> back, steadily turning
your copy to account. Your book’s been
boomed a bit, you’ve caught on, I think. Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
after the solitude of the desert you won’t
object to find pretty women bowing the knee
before you to-night? Mrs. Edgbaston Smith’s
excitement when I offered to bring you this
evening was a sight for the gods!”</p>

<p>“What the devil does one do when they bow the
knee? I’ve been out of the civilized world too
long, it seems— Ah! St. James’s Hall!” Carey
leaned forward a moment, and watched the crowd
on the pavement before the lighted entrance.
“I wonder if there’s a Wagner concert on!” he
said, leaning back with a smile.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“The last time I passed that place,” he remarked,
with a backward nod in the direction of
the Hall, “I was in a hansom with the most
beautiful girl I ever saw in my life. It seems
like yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Sounds as though you were hard hit, old
man! Her image in your heart for five long
years. She ought to have ‘loved another,’ to
make the thing complete. Did she?”</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge, and I’d hardly time to
be hard hit. I met her only once before that
drive, and I sailed next day. We drove from
here to Hackney, to be sure, which is like saying
till the crack of doom.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I understand. Not the blushing <i>ingénue</i>.
I don’t know why, but I imagined she was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Not the blushing sort, certainly, but nevertheless
you don’t understand. It was not the
ordinary episode by any means. She was clever,
very clever. I wonder what has become of her.
If she’s emerged—”</p>

<p>“Emerged? A woman emerges in so many
ways. She may be married, or on the County
Council.”</p>

<p>“Or both, but I meant as a writer. She sent
me some stories to read, I remember, and I was
struck with them. I sent them to Goddard, and
I had a pretty little note from her at Port Said
to say he’d taken them. Oh, tell me about the
people to-night, Trelawney. Remember I’m out
of it. What’s the set?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’ll be the usual lot, no doubt,—Blandford,
Eversleigh, Archie Morefield, and
that young ass Trilling, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know any of them. What do they
do?”</p>

<p>“Tell them you never heard of them! Trilling
will say, ‘How exquisitely subtle!’ or if it’s
Eversleigh, ‘How symbolic!’”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“Oh! anything, nothing. Ask them that too,
and they’ll hurl paradoxes and epigrams at you
till you’ll begin to doubt your own sanity.
You’ll soon see how it’s done; you may even
learn to do it yourself. It’s not difficult. Merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
remember what a normal man says when he’s
asked a plain question, invert it, season to taste
with a few passion-colored adjectives, and serve
up as languidly as possible.”</p>

<p>“Ah! a few passion-colored adjectives may be
useful, I imagine, if that’s the set. Well, go
on.”</p>

<p>“Goldfield will be there, I suppose. Oh! and
Travers and his wife.”</p>

<p>“Paul Travers? I’ve seen his name now and
again. He used to be promising.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s brilliant in a way,—the thin,
sketchy way that’s in vogue just now. He’s by
way of being the high priest of the elect, you know.
He’s got plenty of money, only writes when he
feels like it. I suspect him of being a brute, a
cynical brute. I’m sorry for his wife. I think
you’ll be struck with her. She— Ah! here we
are.” He threw away his cigar as the hansom
drew up before a big house in a gloomy square.</p>

<p>Carey was greeted effusively by his hostess, a
tall, bony woman, with a nervous, flustered
manner, and was speedily and impressively introduced
right and left.</p>

<p>The crowded drawing-room, with its lights
and flowers and babel of conversation, struck him
as somewhat bewildering. He found it hard to
fix his attention upon the lank-haired youth
before him who had begged an introduction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
apparently for the purpose of anathematizing the
prudery of the British public, which by the hand
of its publishers persisted in refusing his distinguished,
if somewhat erotic poems.</p>

<p>Carey glanced round the room with interest.
He had been out of drawing-room life so long
that it had almost the glamour of novelty for
him. He was pleased with the bright, sheeny
folds of the women’s dresses, with the gleam
of diamonds on the white neck of a pretty girl
who stood near him, talking vivaciously; with
the star-like effect of the candles between the
flowers about the room.</p>

<p>He vaguely wondered how many times since
his absence these same men and women had met
and talked, and been bored, and had concealed
or revealed the fact, according to their several
natures. He felt it was marvellous that they kept
up appearances so well. Five years of it! and
Heaven knew how many before that. There was
a little stir and flutter about the door at the
moment, as a fresh arrival was announced.</p>

<p>“There’s Travers—and his wife. Lovely
woman, isn’t she?” he heard some one remark
at his elbow.</p>

<p>A tall, high-shouldered man, with a narrow,
clean-shaven face, was shaking hands with people
near the door. Mrs. Travers was talking to her
hostess. Carey could not see her face just for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
moment, till Mrs. Edgbaston Smith moved aside
to greet new-comers.</p>

<p>She came forward then, smiling, and shaking
hands. Two or three men hurried to meet
her, and she was soon the centre of a little
circle.</p>

<p>“She has altered!” was Carey’s first conscious
thought, after the momentary shock of surprise.
“She is beautiful, but she’s changed!”</p>

<p>She was exquisitely dressed, he noticed, in
white, with a great deal of filmy lace about
the gown. She moved with the same grace
he remembered, and he even recalled the quick
turn of her head as she talked. She did not
look much older at first sight. It was difficult
to tell what constituted the great change in her
appearance; he puzzled over it a moment, and
thought it lay in the expression of her eyes.
He did not know whether he liked the change.
Her face was more interesting. “She has lived
some of the life she wanted so much, I expect,”
he thought as he watched her. Until this evening
he had not thought of the girl for years; now
almost every word of their five years’ old conversation
came back to him. “Bridget Ruan!
Bridget Travers now, of course,” he added, correcting
himself.</p>

<p>He had no opportunity of speaking to her for
some time; the room was very full, and he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
she had not yet recognized him. Once he found
himself standing at the back of her chair. A
young man with long hair, and very loose-jointed
about the knees, was lounging on the corner of
a divan next to her. Carey caught snatches of
their conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes, but they are blind to the exquisite
snake-like charm, to the subtle glamour of sin,
which is the perfect flower of a well-spent life,”
the man peevishly complained.</p>

<p>“You are too hard on them, Mr. Trilling.
You expect too much. They are thoroughly
inartistic, remember. They cleave to goodness
and the Nonconformist conscience, poor deluded
souls! There is a great field before you. Go
out and show them the beauty of sinfulness; it
used to be holiness, you know—but what’s in
a name?”</p>

<p>She spoke in a languid, even tone, leaning
back in her low chair, and holding a large white
fan of feathers, which she moved slowly as she
spoke.</p>

<p>“She has picked up the tone, knows all the
catch-words and the patter, I suppose. I wonder
why I hardly expected it of her?” Carey asked
himself. She was sitting under the light of a
tall standard lamp. Her waving hair was touched
here and there with gleams of dull gold. He
remembered that he had never decided on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
true color of her eyes or hair, and then he
resolutely gave his mind to the confidences of
Miss Yorke-Woodville, who was confiding to him
her burning desire to write a novel.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, as he was entering the
inner drawing-room, he came face to face with
Mrs. Travers. She glanced at him hastily, in
a startled fashion, then put out her hand, and
smiled. Her color rose a little.</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t forgotten me?” Carey said.</p>

<p>“I should be very ungrateful if I <i>had</i>,” she
replied softly. “So you have come back from
the Wonderlands? But of course you came back
long ago?”</p>

<p>“No, I landed on Monday.”</p>

<p>They moved towards some vacant seats near a
door opening into the conservatory.</p>

<p>“What have <i>you</i> been doing these five years?”
Carey asked, sinking into a low seat beside her.</p>

<p>“I? Oh!—” she laughed a little. “I have
married.”</p>

<p>“So I heard.”</p>

<p>“You know my husband?” she said quickly.</p>

<p>“Only through his books,—that is, his earlier
sketches and stories. I’ve been out of things
five years, remember. I thought his work had
great distinction even then, when he was quite a
young writer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is brilliant.” Carey glanced at her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
The words were evidently uttered in all sincerity,
but there was something about her manner
that struck him oddly.</p>

<p>“But you?” he asked. “I’m so anxious to
hear about your work. It was such a pleasure to
me to know that Goddard thought well of the stories
you sent me. You know—if you haven’t forgotten—<i>my</i>
opinion of them,” he added, smiling.</p>

<p>“I haven’t forgotten,” she returned slowly.
“One doesn’t forget criticism of that kind, and
sympathy. The stories were published in the
<i>Coterie</i>,” she continued, indifferently. “They
attracted a little attention at the time.” She
paused, waving her fan with the graceful mechanical
action he had observed before.</p>

<p>“And what have you done since?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I don’t write now; at least, I don’t
publish.”</p>

<p>“But—” he began, protestingly.</p>

<p>“One can’t do two things at once,” she interrupted,
laughing a little. “Nowadays, marriage
is looked upon as a <i>vocation</i>, remember, and one
throws one’s whole heart and soul into such a
dignified thing as a vocation! At least, one
should.” She turned to Carey, and raised her
eyes to his, still laughing. She was a little
flushed, and her eyes were very large and bright.</p>

<p>He did not reply for a moment. “Well! some
of my prophecy has been fulfilled at any rate,
hasn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“Oh, yes! I’ve had my share of the fruit of
the Tree. There’s so much of it—one grows
a little tired of fruit, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“You think the blossoms are best, after all?
Ah, but suppose I had tried to persuade you of
that, five years ago?”</p>

<p>“I should have turned and rent you, of course,”
she said, smiling. “But then no children believe
they wouldn’t like fruit if they could get it.
You must let them make themselves ill with
it before they believe <i>that</i>. Oh, but some of
it was very nice,” she added hastily, with a
change of voice.</p>

<p>“My friends the Mansfields came home about
nine months after you went, and they were
delighted about my little success, of course. I
was invited to a great many different houses.
Oh! I had a lovely time. Everything was fresh
and new and interesting, you understand? I met
my husband at one of these houses,” she added.
“We have been married three years.”</p>

<p>“Mansfield?—my friend Trelawney is engaged
to Professor Mansfield’s daughter. Is—”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Trelawney a friend of yours?” Bridget
said, animatedly. “How strange! Yes, he and
Helen are engaged. She is a great friend of mine.
There she is!” She pointed out a tall girl in
black, with coils of soft fair hair. “But of course
Mr. Trelawney has introduced you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“Yes. I’ve been talking to Miss Mansfield.
She is charming.”</p>

<p>Bridget smiled at him approvingly. She was
very much like the young girl of five years ago as
she did so; the slight, almost imperceptible
hardness in her voice melted, he noticed, when
she spoke of her friend.</p>

<p>“And you?” she said after a moment. “You
have done great things. You have given me no
opportunity of forgetting you,” she added, smiling.
“I’ve read all your articles, and your book.
The book was beautiful.”</p>

<p>The sudden seriousness in her shining eyes
gave him the sense of having received a great
compliment. He remembered that he had felt
flattered when she had expressed her admiration
for his work years ago as a mere slip of a girl.</p>

<p>They talked for some time. Carey forgot that
he had thought her changed. Her languid
manner had vanished; she was eager and responsive
as he remembered her. She had the same
pretty attitude of attention too, the same vivacious
gesture of agreement or dissent.</p>

<p>He was telling her of some experience of his
in Benares, when he noticed her husband leisurely
making his way towards them. He came and
stood before Bridget.</p>

<p>“I’m exceedingly sorry—” he began, and
glanced at Carey, who rose and moved back a step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Something in the man’s voice made his attitude
a little stiff.</p>

<p>“The carriage is here?” she asked, rising.
Carey made a slight involuntary movement—he
hardly knew why—as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said, turning to him. She
gave him her hand with a smile. For a second
she hesitated, then turned away. Carey thought
she blushed a little.</p>

<p>She had not introduced him to her husband,
nor had she asked him to call. He thought of
this as he watched her, followed by her husband,
threading her way towards Mrs. Edgbaston Smith,
with a smile, and a gracious little bow here and
there.</p>

<p>He reflected that he would probably meet her
at the Mansfields.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was striking twelve when Bridget and her
husband reached home. She pushed open a door
on the left of the hall, and touched the button
of the electric light. The fire was still smouldering
on the hearth. She moved towards it,
shivering a little, as she wrapped her cloak closer
round her, and drew up an easy chair, into
which she sank wearily. Her husband came in
a moment later. “Why doesn’t Smithers leave
a decent fire?” he asked irritably, kicking the
logs together with his heel, till he had stirred
them into a blaze.</p>

<p>There was silence. Travers took some whiskey
from the spirit stand on the table, and half filled
a glass with it.</p>

<p>“Beastly dull evening!” he remarked, taking
his cigar-case out of his pocket, and examining
its contents.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t bored,” Bridget said, shortly.</p>

<p>“No? You haven’t lost the faculty, my dear,—deliciously
fresh, if a trifle <i>bourgeois</i>,—of swearing
eternal friendship on an evening’s acquaintance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
There is something very <i>piquant</i> about
you, Bridget. In the midst of this jaded, effete
civilization, you often remind me of the rustic
beauty,—the Miller’s, or the Village Innkeeper’s
lovely daughter!”</p>

<p>He cut off the end of his cigar with great
deliberation as he spoke.</p>

<p>Bridget watched with interest the sharp, direct
thrust of the pen-knife. He glanced furtively at
her, but her face was apparently unmoved. He
could not decide whether the momentary curl of
the lip which he fancied he detected was a trick
of the firelight.</p>

<p>“This <i>is</i> the first time you have met that man,
Carey, of course?” he observed after a moment,
in the same lazy, mocking voice.</p>

<p>“No, it is not the first time.”</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows. “Indeed? He only
landed on Monday, or so I was informed to the
point of exhaustion to-night. It seemed to be
generally understood that the fact was interesting.
I’m sorry it failed to thrill me. Yet you
have met him, you say?”</p>

<p>“I knew him five years ago, before he left
England.”</p>

<p>“Really? This interests me,” he turned his
face towards her. “I always understood that
your distinguished friends in those days were
not numerous. Were you at Rilchester? Ah!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
I see. Yet I should hardly have thought that a
man like Carey— Still—when the daughter is
pretty—” He paused, smiling with half closed
eyes.</p>

<p>Bridget flushed. The slow color began to
mount in her cheeks; it spread to her neck. The
man watched her carefully. His smile became a
little more pronounced.</p>

<p>“I met Mr. Carey at a concert,” she said, and
rose as she spoke, resting her elbow on the mantel-piece,
and facing him. Her voice was still
perfectly cool.</p>

<p>“And dispensed with the ceremony of an introduction?”
He tapped the tips of his fingers
together languidly in applause. “Charming! so
idyllic, so <i>natural</i>. What a pity it is that so
also do even the costers. Well? and then?
Please go on, I’m really not in the least bored.
That was not the extent of your acquaintance,
of course?”</p>

<p>“No, I met him again,” she went on quietly,
fixing her eyes on her husband’s face.</p>

<p>“By request, of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by request. It was through Mr. Carey
that my stories were published.” She paused—“and
through him therefore, indirectly, that I
met you.”</p>

<p>He glanced sharply at her. “I owe Mr. Carey
a thousand thanks,” he said, ironically. “To him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
then, I—and the world—owe a great pleasure; I
can’t conscientiously say a great <i>literary</i> pleasure,
for from what I remember of them the stories
were entirely free from any taint of literary
quality whatever; but they were described, I
think, as <i>powerful</i> and <i>vital</i>, full of human
interest, weren’t they? It sounds a little exhausting.
Power and vitality always strike me
as exhausting, but then the masses have so much
energy. It is Mr. Carey I must thank, then, for
my wife? I have no adequate words to express
my indebtedness.”</p>

<p>Bridget was silent. She stood absolutely motionless.
Her face was like a mask.</p>

<p>“Then, if it is not an impertinent question to
put to one’s wife, I gather that you and Carey
were great friends?—and the rest possibly?”</p>

<p>Bridget broke into a short, scornful laugh.</p>

<p>“Since you ask me, I think the question <i>is</i> a
little impertinent!” she said, lightly.</p>

<p>The man’s face darkened. “Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well! I have long since ceased to inquire
what is the relationship between you and <i>your</i>
many friends.”</p>

<p>“You recognize no difference in our relative
positions, then?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest. Why should I?” she returned,
calmly.</p>

<p>“Then you refuse to answer my question?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>“There can be only one interpretation to put
on your silence.”</p>

<p>“I know, of course, the interpretation you will
put upon it. But that it would be the same one
whether I speak or am silent, I am equally
convinced.”</p>

<p>“You flatter me!” Travers exclaimed. He
flung away the end of his cigar, and rose.
“There’s a fire in the smoking room, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,—one moment, before you go,” Bridget
said. She was very pale.</p>

<p>“I should like to go home to-morrow,” she began.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “My dear, I’m
perfectly willing. Why consult me about such a
trifle? Indeed, if I must choose between having
my mother-in-law here, or your departure, ungallant
though it seems, I prefer the latter evil.
Though my acquaintance with Mrs. Ruan has
been very limited,—I met her twice at lunch,
I think, the last time she paid us a visit,—I
have already exhausted her as a type. I’m afraid
I can get nothing further out of her.”</p>

<p>“I should like to go home to-morrow,” Bridget
repeated, mechanically, “and I shall not come
back.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause. The clock
ticked loud and insistently in the silence.</p>

<p>Travers slowly raised his eyes to his wife’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
face, and looked her deliberately up and down
before he laughed.</p>

<p>“Carey doesn’t waste his time, evidently,” he
said.</p>

<p>Bridget moved back a step abruptly. She
locked her hands tightly together before she
spoke.</p>

<p>“That,” she replied, in a low distinct voice,
“is a cowardly insinuation, and you know it to
be a false one. Will you deny that I have spoken
of this to you before? that I have urged it upon
you as best for both of us? The fact that you
have always treated the matter contemptuously
doesn’t alter the case at all. I have lived this
life too long,” she went on. “I see, I realize
every day, every hour, that I’ve been weak and
cowardly not to have insisted upon my freedom
before! But—but—” her low passionate voice
broke a little—“I <i>dreaded</i> to do it, for mother
chiefly, and I always thought, hoped I was to
blame, that I hadn’t tried enough, that—” she
paused. “Heaven <i>knows</i> I have tried!” she
cried, with a change of voice, raising her head,
and looking him full in the face. “Paul! speak
honestly. If you can, for one moment, lay aside
that sneering, cynical, <i>hateful</i> trick of speech of
yours; speak like a human being for once, and
say if there is in your heart one spark of love or
affection for me any more!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>He quailed for one moment before her brilliant
eyes. Then he recovered himself.</p>

<p>“Love? My dear child, you are remarkably
young! You are a very beautiful woman, Bridget,”
he said critically, turning his head languidly on
one side, with an impartial air. “It’s a pity
you waste yourself upon Adelphi melodrama.
Why not try Ibsen even? Ibsen is dull, but not
altogether meretricious.”</p>

<p>“You have answered my question,—in your own
way, of course, but you have answered it,” she
said, slowly. “You have no love for me, yet you
are unwilling to let me go. Because people
say—because some people praise my looks, it
pleases you to think of me as your property,—<i>yours</i>,
exclusively. You have taken care to try to
crush everything that is best in me,—everything
that makes me an <i>individual</i>, a <i>person</i>, my work,
my hopes, my ideals. It is my beauty only you
want to keep! That is your side of the matter.
As for me—” she stopped. “I have only one
active feeling left towards you.”</p>

<p>He bent a little towards her.</p>

<p>“And that is?”</p>

<p>“Contempt!” she answered swiftly, with a
deep breath. “You will admit, I think (except
of course that the case admits of an excellent
opportunity for a paradox), that with these as the
predominant feelings on either side, our marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
can hardly be described as a success! I never
realized so terribly as to-night,” she went on,
after a moment, the scorn in her voice giving
place to intense earnestness, “how terribly, how
irrevocably, we two people have drifted apart.
Why, I scarcely notice your insults now! I
hardly noticed them to-night. I am indifferent.
Words which, three years ago, I think I should
have <i>died</i> to hear from your lips, don’t touch me,
don’t affect me. Oh, I feel degraded, hateful in
my own sight, to have lived with you, as your wife,
so long! I’m no better than any poor woman
in the street out there!” she cried with a gesture.
“Better? I’m worse—<i>worse!</i> Perhaps
they don’t always despise and hate the men
who— But I will be vile no longer. I can’t
breathe in this life.” Her hand went swiftly to
her throat, as though she felt physical suffocation.
“For the sake of this cowardly keeping up
of appearances, I’ve filled the house with people
I dislike, I’ve had to listen to and learn their
empty, meaningless, surface-clever talk—to lead
their artificial, unnatural life. I’m tired of it—weary
of it all—already; and here I am,”—she
flung out her hands with a quick, vivid gesture,—“young
and strong, with years and years before
me perhaps. I will not waste my life like this!
I too am an individual! I too have my art to think
of—you and your friends, with that word forever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
on your lips, till one sickens at the sound of it,
cannot reasonably deny my right to its expression.
But I must have freedom—real, natural life. I
must touch what is vital, enduring, again.”</p>

<p>She paused, shaken and trembling, resting
her hand against the mantel-piece to steady
herself.</p>

<p>“I’m really sorry to interrupt you; for though
it’s a style I don’t admire, you do it well—excellently
well. Still, there are a few practical
points to be considered when you descend from
the rarefied atmosphere, which seems already to
have affected your breathing.” He regarded her
with an air of mild curiosity as he spoke,
adjusting his eye-glasses with precision.</p>

<p>“In the first place, is it a legal separation you
require? Secondly, how do you propose to live?
You will return to your parents possibly? At
Rilchester you will, of course, get what you
require in the way of natural life,” he continued
impartially. “There is something very vital
and enduring about beer, for instance.” He
paused, took off his eye-glasses and wiped them
carefully before he held them up to the light.</p>

<p>“I shall go home first,” Bridget said. Her
voice was quiet and steady again. “Possibly
afterwards I shall stop with the Mansfields for a
time, and try to get some teaching. In any case,
I shall write. I am not afraid that I shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
unable to earn a living—enough for me, at
least,” she added with calmness.</p>

<p>“And—suppose I object?”</p>

<p>“It is too late for you to object,” she replied
quickly. “I am determined. I will not live
with you. If you had any love for me, any love
whatever,” she repeated, “I would stay. I would
try to make you love me more. I would do <i>anything</i>
for you,” she said brokenly. “But, as
it is, all that is left to me is to get back my
self-respect. From this moment I mean that we
shall be strangers to each other.”</p>

<p>She drew her cloak, with its fleecy white fur,
round her shoulders, and turned from the fire as
though to leave the room.</p>

<p>The man rose and swiftly caught her hands.</p>

<p>“Really?” he whispered. “I <i>don’t</i>. You’re
much too beautiful to part with easily, Bridget!”</p>

<p>He grasped both her hands roughly in one of
his, and with the other drew her to him. His
face was close to hers. Bridget’s eyes met his
glittering ones, as she raised them, startled and
incredulous.</p>

<p>She tore herself free with all the strength of
her slender arms, and stood confronting him, her
eyes blazing, her breath coming in quick, panting
sighs. “I think I am the most miserable fool
alive!” she whispered, with fierce self-scorn.
“I once mistook you for a <i>gentleman</i>, at least. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
can’t forgive myself! Stay where you are!” she
cried sharply, raising her voice. “You will not
<i>dare</i> to touch me. I’m going to leave this house
now, at once, since you are not to be trusted.”</p>

<p>She gathered her cloak over her gleaming
dress, still keeping her eyes on his face, and
crossed the room, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>Travers stood where she had left him. He
heard the sharp imperative whistle for a cab.
The jingle of harness followed almost immediately;
there was a dance at the opposite house
in the Square—he remembered seeing the row
of hansoms waiting, as they drove up. A
moment later, he stood, his head thrust forward,
listening mechanically to the beat of horses’
hoofs on the frosty road.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mansfields’ little flat in College Street
had great attraction for Carey. There was an
air of restful quiet about its daintily furnished
drawing-room, which appealed strongly to some
of his restless moods. He liked the old man’s
clever, easy talk, and Helen’s quiet presence.
For Helen he began very soon to have an almost
affectionate regard. Reserved, far from brilliant,
as she was, there was about her whole
personality an air of silent strength which he
was quick to feel. He liked her tall, graceful
figure, (she was considered too thin by most
people,) her clear pale face lighted by very softly
shining, steady blue eyes, and her coils of flaxen
hair. She was almost immediately at home with
Carey; and before long an easy natural intimacy
had sprung up between them, rather to Trelawney’s
amusement. “Helen’s approval is about
the best testimonial you’ll ever get, old man,”
he said once, with a laugh. “Make the most of
it! Such a dainty, <i>noli me tangere</i> young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
as Helen doesn’t exist! Strangely enough, too,”
he added, confidentially, “for she’s anything but
a prude—doesn’t go in at all for shrinking
ignorance, you understand. She knows good and
evil. I’m a little surprised at some of the people
she admires and likes—sometimes—they’re
not by any means in Mrs. Grundy’s good books.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that Mrs. Grundy was a judge
of character,” Carey remarked.</p>

<p>“Well, no—but a <i>woman</i>, you know.”</p>

<p>“My dear Jim, you’re still sojourning in the
tents of the Philistines,” said Carey, with a
laugh. “Remember that the former things
are passed away—this is the age of the New
Woman!”</p>

<p>“Has one ever a chance of forgetting it?
Helen’s not one of the sisterhood, though,
thank Heaven!”</p>

<p>“She is, and a particularly engaging member,”
Carey replied, calmly.</p>

<p>He had called one afternoon, rather late, after
a hard day’s work. Helen rose from a low couch
drawn close to the fire, as he entered, and came
across the room to meet him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carey! I’m so glad to see you,” she
said, in her gentle fashion, with a touch of
cordiality in her voice which she reserved for
welcome guests.</p>

<p>“Father is out—lecturing, poor dear man!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Aunt Charlotte is away for the day too; so I’m
all alone.”</p>

<p>Carey sank into one of the deep chairs with a
sigh of pleasure.</p>

<p>“How is it your room is always so charming?”
he said, with an appreciative glance right
and left. “It’s like an oasis in the desert.”</p>

<p>Helen laughed softly. “Are things as bad as
that? I should hardly have described London as
a desert,—a rather thickly populated one, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” he replied with a slight,
rather weary movement. “It’s a howling wilderness
to me. I hate it. I’ve got the wander-fever
in my blood, I think. I want to be off
again, back to ‘them spicy garlic smells, and
the sunshine, and the palm trees.’ I hear the
East a-calling too imperiously sometimes, Miss
Mansfield.”</p>

<p>“I expect you are over-working,” Helen said,
looking at him with a little half maternal air
of concern.</p>

<p>There were tired lines about his eyes, though
they were bright and alert as ever.</p>

<p>“Well! I’ve got rather a stiff job at present,”
he admitted, “but I’m going to take a holiday
in a week or two. Jim’s out of town, I hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s in Yorkshire. He has an
important case on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Won’t you play me something?” Carey
asked, after a moment. “I’ve been thirsting
for music all day.”</p>

<p>Helen went to the piano, and he sat absently
gazing into the glowing heart of the fire. The
lamps were not yet brought in, and the room was
nearly dark. The firelight fell full upon his
face as he sat and pondered; the lines on his
forehead deepened into a frown. From her seat
at the piano, in the gloom, Helen glanced at him
now and again, a little curiously, while her
hands stole dreamily over the keys. There was
in his face something that was new to her, something
vaguely dissatisfied. She had an odd
fancy that he was experiencing a sensation new
to him also—that he resented it—was unwilling
to admit to himself its existence. She
found herself speculating upon its nature before
her thoughts slid into another and sadder channel.
The nocturne she was playing, one of Chopin’s,
died away lingeringly, pathetically, and she rose
with a scarcely suppressed sigh.</p>

<p>The door opened at the moment, and the maid
came in with the lamps; she went out again and
immediately re-entered with a letter.</p>

<p>Helen took it quickly from the tray.</p>

<p>“You will forgive me one moment?” she said,
with a glance at Carey. She opened the letter
hastily, still standing at the piano, and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
at its contents. Then she came forward slowly,
the letter in her hand, and sat down by the fire.
Her face was grave.</p>

<p>“It is from Bridget,” she said, turning to him.
He raised his head with a quick movement.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he replied, and waited. There was
something about the tone in which Helen made
the announcement which indicated that she
wished to speak of her friend.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carey,” she said, after a moment, during
which she had sat with averted head, “you
were Bridget’s friend.” There was a note of
half interrogation in the words. He stirred a
little. “She told me,” Helen hastened to say.
“She tells me everything,” she added with a
smile. Carey looked relieved.</p>

<p>“You know that she has been here?—that
she came here the other night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard so. Jim told me.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she replied quickly, turning appealingly
to him. “<i>I</i> want to tell you about Bridget.
Jim and I don’t agree in this matter. But
he has been good,” she added, with a faint
smile. “We have settled not to talk of it. I
have known Bridget all my life,” she went on,
and there was a touch of pride in her voice.
She lifted her head. “I entirely approve of the
step she has taken. I rejoice that she had the
courage to do it when, and in the manner, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
did.” Helen’s pale cheeks flushed a little as
she spoke. She fixed her blue eyes earnestly
on Carey’s face.</p>

<p>“And I too, Miss Mansfield,” Carey said
quickly.</p>

<p>She flashed a grateful glance at him.</p>

<p>“I am glad,” she said. “Bridget will want
all her friends.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Helen sat with
clasped hands resting on her lap, looking musingly
into the fire.</p>

<p>“You don’t know Mr. Travers, I think?” she
asked at last.</p>

<p>“Fortunately—no.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am glad—I am <i>glad</i> Bridget is free!”
Helen broke out all at once. Her quiet voice
was broken and agitated. She rose hurriedly,
and stood leaning against the mantel-piece,
clasping and unclasping her hands nervously.
“I distrusted him always—<i>always!</i>” she went
on; “yet I don’t wonder that she married him.
People have wondered; but I knew—I understood.
No one knows Bridget as I do; no
one understands all the circumstances—” She
stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t known you very long,” she began,
with a little deprecatory smile. “I can’t think
why I am telling you this; but I feel that though
you know so little of her, you are a good friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
of Bridget’s; besides, her life has been influenced
through you—through the stories you
helped her to publish.”</p>

<p>“I am proud to hear anything you choose to
tell me,” Carey said gravely. “I—Mrs. Travers
has always interested me greatly. I foretold
for her a brilliant future.”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>yes</i>—and now perhaps she will have
her opportunity,” Helen broke in eagerly. “We
have been friends since we were children at
school. Bridget used to write then—school-girl
writing, you know; but oh! alive and clever
and vivid, even then—like herself! Her home
life was terrible—unendurable almost. You
know she became a teacher? Father and I were
away about the time she first came to town. We
left London before it was settled she was to live
here. We did what we could about asking
people to look after her, but we haven’t many
acquaintances—and you know how careless
people are; so she had no friends, and was
terribly lonely.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Carey assented.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! she said how good you were!”
Helen paused to say, gratefully. “Well, we
came home at last, just as her first story was
published. People talked about it—some of
them met Bridget at our house, and of course
they were charmed with her. She began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
be asked to different houses: presently she
met Mr. Travers and his set. They all raved
about her—thought her lovely; and so she
was, and is. But you should have seen her
those few months! Her social success came
all at once, following close upon the lonely
lodging-house life she had led for a year.
She was <i>radiantly</i> happy. Everything was
fresh, of course—everything was charming.
She gave even those decadent people a new
sensation—I believe she galvanized some of
them back to life! Mr. Travers made love to
her from the first, and Bridget thought she
cared for him. It was so natural under the
circumstances. You see—” She stopped a
moment. “Bridget’s home life,” she began
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Yes; I know the circumstances of her home
life,” Carey said.</p>

<p>“Well, then, you can understand, perhaps.
Mr. Travers was brilliant, talked well, his manner
was charming. He was to all appearances a
gentleman. Bridget”—she paused a moment—“Bridget
naturally had met very few gentlemen
in her life. Nothing seems to me more
natural, in looking back upon it, than that she
should believe she loved him. They were married
after only a few months’ engagement.”</p>

<p>Helen left off speaking a moment, and sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
down again in her low chair, bending thoughtfully
a little forward, towards the fire.</p>

<p>Carey waited in silence.</p>

<p>“I really know scarcely anything definitely
about their married life,” she said at last, slowly.
“She has said very little, even to me; but I
have been miserable at the change in her. I
could read between the lines. I knew. She
grew hard and cynical and brilliant, like the
people she mixed with. Never to me,” she
added, turning her head swiftly to hide the
tears in her eyes. “It was in self-defence. She
suffered terribly—<i>terribly</i>. I could read it in
her face.”</p>

<p>Carey’s hand tightened its hold on the arm of
the chair.</p>

<p>“The man never loved her,” she went on.
“He was incapable of love, or of any other human
emotion, I believe. It was her beauty—nothing
else—that attracted him. It even made
him tolerate her social position. Bridget told
him at once, before they were engaged; but he
taunted her with it after their marriage,” she
added bitterly. “I learnt more than I ever
knew before, that dreadful night she came here,
when she left his house,” she continued, in a
low tone. “She was more like her old self
than she had been all the three years of her
married life. I cried for thankfulness. If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
knew how it hurt me to see her so changed, so
cold, so indifferent, so self-controlled. It was
so unnatural! The Bridget I remembered was
fearless and outspoken, with a fiery Irish
temper. You ought to have seen her at school,
in a royal rage; her eyes used to <i>blaze</i>—just
like stars on a frosty night!” Helen laughed
unsteadily.</p>

<p>There was silence. “Thank you for telling
me all this,” Carey said presently, very gently.</p>

<p>“I wanted you to know—somehow,” she
replied, turning to him.</p>

<p>“She is at home now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, she would go home, to tell her mother
herself. Poor Bid!” she sighed, and glanced
at the letter on her lap.</p>

<p>“What is she going to do? She will write,
of course. She must write,” Carey said.</p>

<p>“She talked of teaching again, if possible;
but she means to write. Yes! I believe she
will do great things now she is free!” There
was exultation in Helen’s soft voice. “Her
work has been at a standstill for three years,—he
hated it, you know, or pretended to. He is
one of those men who can’t endure women to
have brains. He says, quite openly and seriously,
they should be purely ornamental. I think he
was jealous of Bridget. Poor Bid! Poor Bid!”
she repeated, tenderly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>There was another pause.</p>

<p>“They are to be separated—legally, I think?”
Carey asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. Ah, here’s father!” she exclaimed,
as the door opened, and Dr. Mansfield came in
with outstretched, welcoming hands.</p>

<p>“You’re tired, father. I shall tell Evans to
send you in a cup of tea,” Helen said, going to
the door.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A telegram</span>, the day after Bridget left her
husband’s house, prepared Mrs. Ruan for her
daughter’s arrival. She sat waiting for her in
the drawing-room in the afternoon, in a flutter
of pleasurable excitement. Bridget’s somewhat
infrequent visits were the bright patches of
color in her existence. To go to church with
her on Sunday, to hear the excited whisperings
from the Wilbys’ pew just at the back, to see
all eyes fixed on them as they walked up the
aisle, to know that Bridget’s picture hats,
her well-cut gowns and dainty shoes were being
eagerly scanned, and would serve as food
for voluble, envious criticism on the homeward
walk from the members of every family in
Rilchester, was to her the breath of life. The
greetings after church were only less pleasurable.
They generally walked home with the Jenkins
family; and it was with hardly concealed
joy that Mrs. Ruan observed the silent awe with
which Mr. Jenkins, usually jovial to the point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
of fatigue, from time to time regarded her child—the
Bridget he used to patronize.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was very little changed;
there were a few more terra-cotta plates on the
wall; the tambourines were tied with heliotrope
instead of red ribbons, and there was fresh
pampas grass in the big vases on the mantel-piece—otherwise
it was not materially altered
in appearance in seven years. Neither was
Mrs. Ruan. She was a little grayer, perhaps;
there were a few more wrinkles round her eyes.
She was daintily dressed, as usual, and her
little tea-table was pretty and spotless as ever.</p>

<p>She put down her cross-stitch embroidery, and
ran to the door, almost as quickly as at Bridget’s
home-coming seven years ago, when at last the
welcome sound of wheels reached her ears.</p>

<p>But Bridget did not run upstairs. She did
not see her mother at first, and Mrs. Ruan was
struck with the slow, tired way in which she
moved.</p>

<p>“My dear child, are you ill?” she cried,
anxiously, clasping and kissing her. “Yes, you
are!” she exclaimed, drawing her into the light.
“Bid, how dreadfully white and thin you’ve
grown, my dear girl!”</p>

<p>She pushed her gently into a seat by the fire,
and took off her thick gloves and cloak, with
little soft flurried exclamations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Bridget’s lips quivered. She bowed her face
suddenly on her mother’s shoulder, and broke
into low sobbing.</p>

<p>“My dear! my dear!” repeated Mrs. Ruan,
in a frightened voice; then all at once her
face cleared. She looked at her daughter with
hopeful, questioning eyes. Bridget caught her
look, and flushed, drawing herself a little away.
Her tears ceased.</p>

<p>“Give me some tea, mother,” she begged.
“We will talk afterwards.”</p>

<p>When the maid had taken out the tea-things
Bridget drew her chair close to her mother’s.
She sat stroking her hand, but looking away
from her into the fire.</p>

<p>“How long can you stay, Bid?” asked Mrs.
Ruan, anxiously.</p>

<p>Bridget did not reply at once. Then she
slowly turned her head.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she said, below her breath, “I
came to tell you—I have left my husband.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan pushed her chair back, and gazed
incredulously at her daughter.</p>

<p>“Left—<i>what</i> did you say, Bridget?”</p>

<p>“I’ve left him—forever,” Bridget repeated
more firmly. Mrs. Ruan looked at her a moment
longer, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Was there ever such a girl!” she sobbed.
“You’ve always been a trouble to me—<i>always!</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
and now, just when you’re settled and comfortable,
and us so glad and thankful—and
your beautiful house, and the carriage, and all
those servants!—and the disgrace of it! What
will every one say? How those Wilbys will
talk, and how glad they’ll be. I can never hold
up my head again—<i>never</i>. And your father—Bridget,
you’re <i>mad</i>. You can’t know what
you’re talking about!”</p>

<p>Bridget sat with lips tightly closed, and a
white face.</p>

<p>“Not a word about <i>me</i>!” she broke out at
last, bitterly. “Do you suppose I’m doing this
without a cause? Do you think that if my life
hadn’t been unendurable, I—? As it is, I’ve
stayed with him and borne it for three years,
for <i>you</i>, because I couldn’t bear to hurt you!
Oh, mother! mother!” The last word was a
cry of appeal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan was not deaf to it, even in the
midst of her selfish grief.</p>

<p>“Tell me what it’s all about,” she cried,
turning to the girl. “You always <i>were</i> too
’asty, Bridget. Even if there’s another woman,
it’s no good flying in the face of Providence.
What a woman’s got to do is to humor a man
till he comes round to ’er again. I’ve been
through it all with your father, Bid; so I know.
It doesn’t do to be too hard on men; at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
rate, it’s no <i>use</i>. They’re all alike. Women
have all got to bear it, and you’ll ’ave to bear
it too. There <i>is</i> another woman, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh! as to that—” Bridget gave a little
scornful laugh, and left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>“But, mother, you <i>loved</i> father!” she said,
turning eagerly to her. “You love him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course; ’Enry and I always got on
very well together, on the whole. He’s got ’is
faults, of course; we all ’ave. He’s a violent-tempered
man, as you know, but—”</p>

<p>“Well, but I <i>don’t</i> love my husband. I—I—<i>despise</i>
him. He doesn’t love me. That is
why I have decided to leave him—isn’t that
reason enough?”</p>

<p>“Reason?” repeated Mrs. Ruan, beginning
to cry again. “You have no reason in you,
Bridget. Suppose every one was to leave their
husbands just because they didn’t love them, as
you call it.”</p>

<p>“The world would be a much cleaner place,”
said Bridget, in a tense voice.</p>

<p>“I must say I have no patience with these
new-fangled, high-flown ideas, as your father
would say,” Mrs. Ruan exclaimed. “No one
ever thought of such things in my young days.
We should have thought it wicked and immodest.
And so it is!” she went on, suddenly recollecting
that she had entirely forgotten a powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
argument. “It’s sinful. What does the Bible
say?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” returned Bridget,
sighing wearily.</p>

<p>“Well, the Prayer-Book, at any rate, says,
‘till death us do part,’—it’s God’s will.”</p>

<p>“Mother, how is it you never think of God
except to allude to Him as a sort of fetish to be
dreaded when one wants to do what is morally
right?” Bridget exclaimed, in her old, passionate
way.</p>

<p>“And now,” cried her mother, “I’m told by
my own child that I never think of God!—when
I say my prayers night after night, and
always ’ave done since I was a girl. And if
you’d said more, Bid, perhaps—”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother!” Bridget interrupted, in a
tired, broken voice, “don’t let us argue; what is
the use of it? Won’t you be a little sorry for
me? If I only cared for him ever so little, or
he for me, I could forgive many things. I would
stay, and try to make things right; but as it is—if
you knew how I feel—how I hate and
loathe my life—myself—<i>everything</i>. And—I’m
so tired,” she added, pitifully.</p>

<p>The look of suffering in the girl’s face softened
the elder woman, in spite of herself. She
smoothed back her hair, crying all the time, and
Bridget clung to her in passionate gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“And I, hoping—” began her mother, presently.
But a sudden movement from Bridget
made her leave the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>“Thank God, no!” she exclaimed. “If so, I
should be a wretched woman, indeed! As it
is, I feel too dazed, too sorry for hurting <i>you</i>, to
take pleasure in my freedom yet. But some
day, perhaps, I may be happy again, when I can
be <i>myself</i> once more.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan sighed. “Are you going to get a
divorce?” she asked, anxiously, after a moment.</p>

<p>“No. It’s not a question of divorce at all.
I only want to live alone. There is to be a
separation. That will be arranged, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“’Ow I’m to tell your father, and what he’ll
say, I don’t know,” her mother continued, sobbing.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him—but to-morrow. May I go to
bed soon, mother dear? You can tell him I’m
not well,” Bridget said, rising. “Let us talk
to-morrow. I—I can’t to-night.”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to do?” persisted
her mother. “You’ll ’ave a good allowance, of
course?”</p>

<p>“No; I won’t touch a penny, even if it’s
offered to me,” Bridget said hotly, turning at
the door, and facing her mother. “Would <i>you</i>
take money from a man who has never lost an
opportunity of insulting you—your relations?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
That’s why I thank Heaven I have no child.
One never knows what one may be tempted to
do for the sake of one’s child. As it is, I can
work. I worked before I was married. I can
work now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruan did not reply, except by a melancholy
shake of the head. She followed her
daughter from the room, wiping her eyes and
sighing deeply as she went.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridget</span> arrived at the flat in College Street
one evening, a week after her visit to Rilchester.
She was pale and thin, Helen noticed, as she
helped her lay aside her wraps in her bedroom
upstairs. All the evening she was very silent.
She said little just then about her home visit;
but Helen gathered that there had been a painful
scene when she explained its purport to her
father.</p>

<p>The next day she began to make inquiries
about work with feverish eagerness. Partly
through her influence at the Hackney school,
partly as a result of Dr. Mansfield’s exertions
on her behalf, it was not long before she was
able to get enough to satisfy her for the immediate
present, at all events.</p>

<p>“I never knew such a girl!” Helen exclaimed
one morning, looking at her critically as she
stood tying on her veil before the glass. There
was color in her cheeks, her eyes were bright
and happy, as she caught up her gloves and her
books in haste to start. “I believe you love
being worked to death. You look radiant!”
Bridget turned to her swiftly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Wait till you’ve passed three years of
wretched, enforced idleness,” she said, catching
her breath, “and then tell me if it isn’t
<i>bliss</i> to work.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She had returned one day rather late from
an afternoon class, to find the drawing-room
deserted. Tea was laid on a low table before a
brightly burning fire, and she drew her chair
towards it with a sigh, half weariness, half content.
For a long time she sat holding her cup
and saucer in her lap, gazing steadily into the
fire. She was startled from her musing by the
sound of a ring. A moment later the maid opened
the drawing-room door, followed by Carey.</p>

<p>Bridget rose hastily, putting down her cup,
and gave him her hand, smiling.</p>

<p>“Helen is out,” she said, “shopping with
Miss Mansfield, you know. It’s perfectly delightful
to see Helen excited over her frocks,”
she went on, confidentially, with a little laugh,
as Carey took the chair opposite to her. “In
the old days, before Jim, she always reminded
me of the lilies of the field, in her serene toil
not attitude towards her clothes. Now, chiffon
is a vital question; she doesn’t consider it a
matter for jesting, and I’m considered flippant
because I don’t approach the subject with sufficient
reverence.” She laughed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Are you held to be unworthy to officiate in
these solemn rites, then?” Carey asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I should have gone shopping
also, with a solemnity befitting the occasion,
but I have a class at Forest Hill on Tuesdays,
you know. I’ve only just come in. Let me
implore you not to go away with the idea that
I despise chiffons!” she added, earnestly. “I
love them—I always have; and if any one at
my baptism promised in my name to renounce
them, it was like his impertinence.”</p>

<p>She was pouring out tea as she talked. Carey
absently watched her white, slender fingers
touching the dainty pink china as she moved
the cups on the tray. She wore a perfectly
plain dark serge dress. As he crossed to the
tea-table to take the cup she held out to him,
she raised her face. Her bright eyes were
filled with amusement; there was a smile on
her lips. She looked much as she did when he
first met her. His impression of her as a brilliant,
self-contained woman of the world seemed
curiously incongruous in the presence of her
newly recovered girlishness.</p>

<p>“You are teaching, then?—and writing too,
I hope?” Carey asked. “You like teaching,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Children, yes; grown-ups, no,” she returned.
“Children are charming, simply charming, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
they’re listening intently to the words of wisdom
that fall from one’s lips. It’s necessary to
make the words fall in somewhat eccentric positions,
by the way, or else this admirable intentness
is not observable to any great extent. But
when one <i>does</i> get the whole attention of a class
of little children, there’s nothing quite like it,
for pure pleasure. Their serious eyes are so
pretty, and their characteristic attitudes of attention
are sweet too. By which remark you
will have discovered that I’m no formal disciplinarian.
When I was at school they <i>clicked</i>
at us with a miserable little wooden apparatus.
One click meant <i>hands in laps</i>; two clicks, <i>sit
bolt upright</i>; three, <i>attention!</i>—which, being
interpreted, signified, take every atom of individuality
out of your personal appearance, and
become as much like a little automaton as circumstances
will permit. Oh, if I could have
ground that clicker to pieces!” They both
laughed.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to have been a complete
success in your case,” he said. “The figure
would not work, in fact.”</p>

<p>“No; but then I never conformed to anything.
I suppose I never have. There are
some people who are born to kick against the
pricks—foolish, no doubt; it wears one’s shoes
out, and if they are pretty shoes it seems a pity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
but—” She gave her shoulders a little shrug,
and paused.</p>

<p>“Better are shabby shoes and freedom therewith,”
returned Carey, looking up with a smile;
and then he too paused abruptly. It struck
him, suddenly, that he had trenched unintentionally
upon delicate ground.</p>

<p>Bridget flushed a little.</p>

<p>“I’m so anxious for your book to come out,
Mr. Carey,” she said, rather hastily. “Everything
you write has the sunshine lying right
across it,—real hot sunshine! I like the way
you have of bringing Eastern scenes before
one’s mind by a single word, sometimes. I
always think, if you hadn’t written you would
have painted; you would have been a great
colorist,” she added, with the quick, pretty
smile which always conveyed to Carey a sense
of flattery more subtle than her frank words.</p>

<p>“Well, my poor old grandfather, at any rate,
would have blessed you for that remark. He
brought me up, you know; he was a painter himself.
It was a great blow to the dear old boy
that I didn’t take to his trade. That reminds
me,” he added suddenly, putting his cup down,
and looking across curiously at Bridget. “I’ve
been haunted ever since I knew you by your
likeness to some one. You know what a tantalizing,
maddening thing a likeness you can’t fix<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
is. Now I know! You are exactly like a
sketch of his—one he made when he was a
young man, somewhere in the north of Ireland.
It’s the head of a girl—”</p>

<p>“A fisher girl?” Bridget cried, eagerly. She
rose and went to a writing-table. “Not this?
I brought it down to show Helen yesterday,”
she said, coming towards him. She put the
sketch into his hands.</p>

<p>Carey half rose from his seat. “Bridget
O’Hea! This is his writing—this is the
Bridget he mentioned once. Who is she?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“My grandmother,” she answered, smiling.
“She was just a fisher girl at Dara’s Bay in
Galway.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met. “My grandfather said she
was the loyalest and best, as well as the loveliest
woman in Ireland,” he returned. “You are
like her. Very like her,” he added, glancing
from the sketch to Bridget.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” Her color rose a little; her
face wore a softened, grateful look. “I’m glad
to hear that, though I don’t remember her,” she
said. “I have always been interested in this
grandmother of mine.”</p>

<p>Carey leant back in his chair, and gazed musingly
at the sketch. “How strange!” he said.
“There was a romance, you know,” he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
on slowly, after a moment. “My grandfather
loved her—he never forgot her, I believe.”</p>

<p>“And she?” Bridget asked, breathlessly, with
parted lips.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. She was a married woman,
with two or three children, when he met her; and
as loyal a one as ever breathed, he said, the
only time he spoke of her; but whether she
cared for him—”</p>

<p>“Ah! she did—she did, I’m sure,” Bridget answered
swiftly, bending over the picture. “You
poor little grandmother!” she added softly.
She rose, and silently replaced the sketch, laying
it gently, almost reverently, he noticed, in the
drawer.</p>

<p>When she came back to her seat she was
silent a moment, fingering the tassels of the
work-bag in her lap absently, with a trace of
nervousness. This discovery seemed to have
brought them in some peculiar fashion suddenly
near to one another. Bridget felt all at once
unaccountably shy.</p>

<p>“It is so strange,” she said quietly at last,
breaking a somewhat awkward silence, “that it
was all so long ago. Yet how young she looks!
I remember I spoke of her the first time I ever
saw you—” She stopped.</p>

<p>“At the Wagner concert,” Carey said, finishing
the sentence. “I remember, when you told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
me your name was Bridget, I said to myself,
quite involuntarily, <i>Bridget O’Hea</i>, and the
thought of the sketch flashed through my mind.
That was a delightful evening. Can’t we go
to another Wagner concert together, Mrs.
Travers, for auld lang syne?”</p>

<p>He waited, with a touch of eagerness in his
look, for her answer.</p>

<p>“We will make up a party. Helen wants to
go to the next one; and Jim will tolerate Wagner,
for the sake of Helen, for one evening,”
she said, unconcernedly.</p>

<p>“Let us consider it an arrangement, then, if
the others agree,” Carey replied, in the same
tone.</p>

<p>Bridget did not speak at once. She put her
head back against her chair, a trifle wearily;
her color had faded; she looked pale and tired.</p>

<p>Carey rose and fetched a cushion from the sofa.</p>

<p>“Sit up a moment; let me put this for your
head,” he said, with the air of gentle authority
she had noticed once or twice in his voice. It
sent her thoughts back to the night she was so
tired, so dreadfully tired, after the concert, when
he had taken care of her.</p>

<p>She didn’t want the cushion; but it was nice
to be taken care of. She raised her head, as he
told her, with a smile, and he arranged the
pillow with deft, capable hands. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
always liked the decided way he touched things;
it was a sort of translation of his voice, she
thought.</p>

<p>“You are tired. You are working too hard, I
believe,” he said, going back to his seat.</p>

<p>“Only a little tired. I suppose I <i>am</i> working
hard; but I like it, thank you.”</p>

<p>“You teach all day, and write all night,” he
went on, looking at her deliberately and critically.
“You will always wear yourself out—it
is your nature, I suppose. The first time I
ever saw you—”</p>

<p>“You told me it was my duty to have a sort
of Lord Mayor’s luncheon every day,” she interrupted,
laughing. “Oh! I’m not working too
hard. I certainly don’t write all night; though
sometimes, I own, it’s a little late when I happen
to look at the time,” she added, with an air of
great candor. “I’ve been lucky enough to get
work on the <i>Tide</i>, thanks to Dr. Mansfield,
you know; so a great deal of it is writing that
must be done.”</p>

<p>“And the rest?”</p>

<p>“Oh!—experiments—attempts at the impossible,
I’m afraid. I’ve got back my old longing
for experience—always experience. Directly
one begins to write one is conscious how little
one knows—<i>really</i> knows, I mean. I should
like to have lived the life of every one of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
characters—I ought to have lived it, to write
about them.”</p>

<p>“That would make existence a somewhat long
drawn out affair. Even the theosophists have
more mercy; they draw a veil of oblivion between
the lives in most cases, don’t they? Besides,
where does imagination come in?”</p>

<p>“Imagination is useful, certainly. Intuition
is better—much better; but an ounce of experience
is worth either of them six times over!”
she declared. “It’s rather a demoralizing occupation—writing,
I mean; don’t you think so?”
she went on presently. “You begin, in time, to
feel like a moral kaleidoscope, constantly shifting
from one set of emotions to another, till you
don’t know which is the real you—or if you’ve
got a <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>Carey laughed a little. “I think there’s a
very decided <i>you</i> at the back of the kaleidoscope,”
he said, rising as he spoke. “It colors
all the little pieces of glass. I’m dining at
Lady Vernon’s to-night,” he added, glancing at
the clock. “Is it really half-past six.”</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. “Good-bye,” she
said, looking frankly at him. She wondered
vaguely why his appearance always suggested to
her so much strength and reliability. He was
rather gracefully than strongly built—far from
being a physically powerful man; yet she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
always thought that if she were ever in an accident—a
fire, or a railway smash, for instance—she
would prefer to obey Carey’s directions to
any man’s she knew. Something told her he
would be absolutely calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p>He held her hand a moment in his firm clasp.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t work too hard,” he said,
looking down at her; “but I’m glad you’re
working.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Ten minutes later Helen came in, followed by
Miss Mansfield.</p>

<p>“Bid! all alone? How long have you been
in?” Helen said, crossing the room towards
Bridget’s chair.</p>

<p>She knelt down before the fire, and, pulling
off her gloves, held her hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>“The silk matches to perfection!” Miss Mansfield
announced triumphantly. “Helen, you’ll
get chilblains. I’m going straight upstairs to
change my dress before I sit down.”</p>

<p>Helen laid one hand caressingly on her friend’s
lap.</p>

<p>“Tired and lonesome, Bid?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No; Mr. Carey has been here, and we’ve
been talking.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“Oh, most things. We’ve discovered that
our respective grandparents were in love with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
one another. Isn’t that thrilling?” She gave
a rapid little sketch of the discovery.</p>

<p>Helen looked gravely into the fire, and was
silent.</p>

<p>Bridget laughed. “I know what you’re thinking,”
she said, with a malicious flash of her eyes.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That history repeats itself, and that I shall
fall in love with Mr. Carey.”</p>

<p>Helen looked a trifle disconcerted. “You
are a trying person, Bid,” she returned, after a
moment. “You always were an <i>enfant terrible</i>.
You’ve preserved most of your aggravating
school-girl habits, and added to them grown-up
ones which are ten times worse. Do you always
say just what comes into your head, if it happens
to be true?”</p>

<p>“No, very seldom,” Bridget returned, calmly.
“For the last few years I’ve said everything
that came into my head that happened to be
false. It was required of me, and I soon learnt
the trick. Ah, no, you needn’t be afraid. I
am sick of love!” She made a hasty gesture
with her hands, as of flinging something from
her. There was a pause.</p>

<p>“I saw him to-day, as I came across the
park,” she said presently, very quietly. “He
was with that woman—Mrs. Gefferson. You
know who I mean. They didn’t see me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Helen turned her head. “You poor child,”
she said gently. “London isn’t big enough,
after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” Bridget returned, in a
colorless voice. “Perhaps it’s dreadful that I
have so little feeling left. I looked at him
to-day as though he were a stranger. I couldn’t
realize that I had lived with him for three
years. Do you remember,” she went on, after a
moment, “the night we saw the ‘Doll’s House,’
there was a derisive laugh when Nora says, ‘I
can’t stay in the house with a strange man’?
How little imagination people have! That’s
how <i>I</i> feel. He is a strange man; I have nothing
to do with him. Thank Heaven, the first
shameful feeling of it has all gone. I’m quite
indifferent now. <i>Love?</i>” She gave a short,
scornful laugh.</p>

<p>Helen winced. “You have never loved yet,
Bridget,” she said, gravely.</p>

<p>Bridget turned to her with a swift movement.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’m a brute to speak so,” she exclaimed
softly. “You and Jim—yes, that is different.
I’m so glad it’s different.” She rose impulsively,
and put her arms round her friend.</p>

<p>Helen still looked troubled. “Bid, you puzzle
me. Shall I ever know such a mass of contradictions,
I wonder? Why did you laugh about—about—?
I should never have said that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
feared it for you,” she went on, desperately;
“but, Bid, it is not an impossibility that some
day—and then I should be so afraid!” She
dropped her voice, and hurried over the last
sentence.</p>

<p>“Dear, I laughed—why did I laugh? Just
out of mischief, because I can so easily tell your
thoughts. I wasn’t thinking of the importance
of what I said—just because that sort of thing
seems so far from me—so impossible. I don’t
want it!” she added vehemently. “I won’t
have it. You said I had never loved. I believe
you are right. I think I never did. I was
dazzled; and what I took for the sun was just
very poor electric light, that had a trick of
going out suddenly. I don’t want the experience
twice over,” she went on, shuddering. “I pray
Heaven I may never have it. I’ve been talking
to Mr. Carey about wanting every experience
life has to offer,” she said, speaking slowly,
“and yet I’m praying Heaven not to send me
the supreme, the most tremendous of all possible
experiences. Strange, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to Helen’s, and saw they
were full of tears.</p>

<p>“You said once, when you were a precocious
little girl, that Heaven never by any chance
answered prayers,” Helen said, trying to speak
lightly. Her voice was not steady, however.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter wore on, and Bridget remained with
the Mansfields. Every attempt on her side to
urge that she ought to take rooms was met by
determined opposition on the part of her friends.
Finally, it was settled, that she should stay at
any rate, till after Helen’s marriage, which
was arranged for the middle of May. Helen
never forgot the evenings of that winter, when
the curtains were drawn, and the shaded lamps
and the firelight made their little drawing-room
glow like a warmly tinted jewel. Nearly every
night two or three people came in after dinner,
in informal fashion. Her father would sit in his
huge arm-chair on one side of the fire, talking
with the eagerness of a boy of the last new
poem, or the extraordinary promise of this or
that young painter. Bridget, sometimes in a
fantastic, sometimes a whimsical, less often in
a serious mood, moved about the room, talking
and laughing in her eager, vivid fashion. She
was a girl again then, Helen said to herself
with a thrill of pleasure—the Bridget of three
years ago—quick, impulsive, with as many moods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
as there were hours in the day, sometimes in
the highest heaven of delight, sometimes the
uttermost depths of dejection. She never spoke
of her husband. By tacit consent, his name was
rarely mentioned between them. “I want to
tear out that chapter, and burn it,” she said
once. “It will have to be destroyed in a slow
fire; but in the end it will perish utterly.”</p>

<p>Imperceptibly, however, as the months went
on, Helen noticed a change in her. A growing
restlessness possessed her. “Bid, you’re getting
too thin,” she said, one morning, looking
at her critically, as she sat down to breakfast.
“Also your eyes are too big.”</p>

<p>“The better to see you with, my dear,”
Bridget replied, helping herself to sugar. She
laughed a little nervously as she spoke.</p>

<p>“You rush about too much. I think you’ve
undertaken far too much work,” Helen went
on, in a dissatisfied tone. “I never see you all
day now; you tear from one place to another
like one possessed! Your writing will suffer.
I don’t believe you’ve put pen to paper for
weeks. Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—there isn’t time,” Bridget
said vaguely. “I can’t write now,” she went
on, with a touch of desperation in her tone. “I
don’t know what’s the matter with me!” She
moved restlessly in her chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“I can tell you—over-work; isn’t it, Aunt
Charlotte?”</p>

<p>“That’s what Mr. Carey always says about
Bridget,” Miss Mansfield said, placidly sipping
her tea. “By the way, he doesn’t come in so
often now; he hasn’t been here for quite a
fortnight. James was only remarking upon it
yesterday. Ah!” as her brother entered the
room at the moment. “James, we were just
saying that Mr. Carey has deserted us.”</p>

<p>“Busy, I expect, seeing his book through,”
the Professor said, taking his seat at the table.
“Bridget, my dear, you’re not off, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear sir, if you will excuse me. I’m due
at Hampstead at ten o’clock.” She waved a smiling
farewell to him, and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>“That child doesn’t look strong,” Dr. Mansfield
observed meditatively, taking his cup of
coffee from his sister.</p>

<p>“She isn’t; she’s working herself to death
for no reason whatever,” Helen exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he returned, raising his eyes a moment
to Bridget’s empty place. He was very silent
throughout the meal. She was unusually gay
that evening. Her color was so brilliant that
at first sight the hollowness of her cheeks was
hardly observable. Dr. Mansfield watched her
as she talked. The men who stood round her
laughed a good deal; their admiration was almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
as plainly perceptible as their amusement.
Once, when the door opened, he saw her quick
eyes glance in the direction; he noticed the
little half-expectant turn of her head, though
she did not cease speaking. She crossed the
room towards him a moment afterwards, followed
by the young man with whom she was
talking, to make some laughing appeal for his
decision in an argument. The Professor experienced
a sudden pang as he looked at her smiling
face. Her eyes were bright with what he fancied
were unshed tears; the look in them haunted him
for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>“Well,” Helen said, as they parted at
Bridget’s bedroom door, “I’m glad to-morrow
is Sunday. You’ll be obliged to rest. Do try
to moderate the size of those eyes, child; they
frighten me.”</p>

<p>“Any one would think I was made of priceless
china, to hear the way this family talks,”
Bridget returned, with a laugh and a shrug of
her shoulders as she kissed her.</p>

<p>Her smile faded when she closed the door of
her room. The fire sparkled on the hearth.
Drawn up beside it was a little writing-table,
at which she worked. She moved towards it,
and stood absently fingering the scattered papers.
On the shelf above were some framed
photographs. She put up her hand mechanically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
and took one of them from its place.
It was the reproduction of a photograph of
Carey, cut from one of the illustrated papers.
She held it where the firelight shone upon it,
and looked at it steadily for a moment. All at
once, with a hurried movement, she rose and
thrust it out of sight in one of the drawers of
her dressing-table. She did not sit down again,
but instead, began to walk up and down the
room, feverishly clasping and unclasping her
hands. Presently she turned the light higher,
and went to her writing-table. She resolutely
gathered up the loose papers, sorting and arranging
them. Her lips were tightly closed, and
her hands moved restlessly from one leaf to
another. She took up a pen and bent over the
sheets, pushing her hair from her face with a
gesture familiar to her from childhood. She
wrote a line or two—then paused; two or three
words followed; then all at once she thrust the
paper violently from her, and buried her face
in her hands with a groan. “Oh, I can’t—I
<i>can’t</i> bear it!” she half whispered, incoherently.
“I didn’t know it was like this. Why doesn’t
he come?—at least—at least he might come.
I should see him;—I shouldn’t be so starved.”
She rose, and flung herself beside the bed, and
buried her face in the pillow.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Spring</span> was early, and very gracious, the year of
Helen’s marriage. Day after day warm sunshine
lighted up the little square where the
lilacs and hawthorns were budding, and the
crocuses blazed with purple and golden flames
in the grass borders.</p>

<p>“We’ll go into the country, all of us, one
day before I’m married,” Helen declared. “I
want to pick primroses—don’t you want to
pick primroses, Bid? It shall be <i>my</i> day. I
will take father and you and Aunt Charlotte—and
Jim, if he’s good—and Mr. Carey,
if he’ll come, because he’s Jim’s friend;
also because I like him. When shall we go?
Next Saturday, shall we?—because it’s Bid’s
holiday!”</p>

<p>The Professor and Miss Mansfield fell in with
her whim, and the little party was arranged for
the following week. Trelawney undertook to
discover a place at Bushberry—their proposed
destination—where they could get lunch and
tea. Helen stipulated for a farmhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>They met Carey at Victoria, the following
Saturday. He came up just as the train was
starting, and was execrated and dragged into
the carriage unceremoniously by Trelawney.
There was a babel of laughter and greetings as
the train moved out of the station.</p>

<p>“I expected to see Jim got up like Corydon,
with a smock frock and a crook, and an oaten
pipe in his waistcoat pocket,” Carey declared.
“It was entirely owing to my hesitation about
my own apparel for this Arcadian festival that I
was late. This is a delicious idea of yours,
Miss Mansfield,” he said, turning to her. “I
haven’t been into an English wood in spring for
years.”</p>

<p>“He’s relying exclusively on this experience
to provide him with lyrics for the next twelve
months,” Trelawney explained. “He looks
upon this day from a purely pecuniary standpoint,
believe me. Helen, it’s an idyllic farmhouse;
there is surrounding it an aura of butter
and cream and new-laid eggs. And you get
your tea for ninepence a-head.”</p>

<p>Bridget struck in with a laughing comment.
At the sound of her voice Carey turned to her
for the first time.</p>

<p>“It is ages since we met, Mrs. Travers,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Is it?” she returned. “We have both been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
busy, I suppose. One doesn’t notice how the
time goes when one is busy.”</p>

<p>She leant back, and watched the green fields
they were whirling through, abstractedly. “We
seem to have left the streets behind very
quickly,” she said, presently. “How delicious
the color of that grass is!—and see, the trees
are in full leaf, almost!”</p>

<p>Carey was conscious of a coldness, a certain
constraint, in her manner he had never noticed
before. It had all at once become difficult to
talk to her. The realization of this fell blankly,
depressingly, upon him.</p>

<p>The impression did not wear off when they
reached the little country station, and began
to climb the hill, between white hedgerows,
towards the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Helen and Trelawney walked on a little ahead.
Bridget and he followed with the Professor and
Miss Mansfield, and the conversation was
general; yet through it all he intuitively felt
the new distance in her manner towards him.
Her words were gay enough. She stopped,
every now and then, with a delighted exclamation,
before a hawthorn bush, veiled in bridal
white, and he cut blossom-laden branches for
her till her arms were full.</p>

<p>“They’ll die, Bridget,” Miss Mansfield expostulated.
“What is the use of picking them now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>She declared that they would adorn the
luncheon-table most appropriately, and, when
the farmhouse was reached, busied herself in
putting the dazzling white boughs in great brown
jars on the table.</p>

<p>Lunch was served in the farmhouse parlor,
with the lattice windows open to the sweet
spring air, and the sunlight lying in checkered
squares across the coarse white table-cloth and
on the flagged floor.</p>

<p>Bridget sat opposite to Carey at the table,
with the faint blue sky for background behind
her dusky hair. He had not seen her for several
weeks, and the change in her was very noticeable.
He was struck by the thin outline of her
cheek when he caught her face in profile. He
wondered vaguely whether she was ill, or overworked.</p>

<p>When lunch was over, they started for the
woods. Their way led through level meadows,
starred with pale cuckoo flowers. Here and
there cowslips lifted their delicate green stalks
and dainty yellow blossoms. From the woods,
covered by a misty veil of green, the cuckoo’s
note rang clear and dainty sweet.</p>

<p>“Cuckoo! cuckoo!” Bridget repeated. She
stopped every now and then to snap a cowslip
from its stalk.</p>

<p>“They break so crisply, it’s a delight to pick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
them!” she exclaimed, and tucked the bunch
she had gathered into the front of her gown.</p>

<p>“I can’t be altruistic about flowers. I <i>want</i>
them. I must have them!” She put her lips
down to those on her breast and caressed
them.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it delicious—<i>delicious</i> to be in the
country in the spring?” she said, raising shining
eyes to the Professor. She took his arm,
with a little affectionate movement. The smiling
glance they exchanged was full of mutual
understanding and sympathy. In the wide,
sunny meadow Bridget seemed to Carey to be
herself again; though she spoke very little to
him directly, the intangible barrier between
them was, he felt, in some way broken down.</p>

<p>A stile separated the fields from the woods
they were to pass through in the walk they had
planned.</p>

<p>A winding, mossy path, across which gnarled
roots of trees made easy steps, led slightly
upwards. The trees were not yet in full leaf;
the sycamores still held some of their dainty
rose-pink sheaths, from which the brilliant
translucent green was breaking. The larches,
enveloped in a mysterious filmy green mist,
wavered in the sunshine. All the underwood
was in full leaf. It sprang from a carpet of
russet and yellow,—the leaves of yester year;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
nestling between them were clumps of primroses.
Their pure pale yellow stars burnt
softly above their dark bed. Here and there
the ground was white with frail anemones.</p>

<p>Bridget dived into the thicket with a rapturous
exclamation, and began to fill her basket,
heedless of Carey’s laughing assurances of open
spaces farther on.</p>

<p>The rest of the party walked on more soberly.
When they emerged—Bridget with loosened
hair where the sweeping branches had caught
it, but triumphant, with half filled basket—they
were out of sight. She sent a swift glance
up the empty, sun-flecked path.</p>

<p>“The road is quite easy to follow,” Carey
hastened to say. “It leads in a half-circle back
again to the farm, though it’s a good long
walk. We shall find our way, though they
seem to have deserted us.” They walked in
silence for a moment—a silence which Bridget
broke with a question about some book.</p>

<p>Carey replied with an eagerness somewhat out
of proportion to the subject; but the conversation,
once started, did not flag.</p>

<p>He did not look at her as they walked, but
kept his eyes fixed on the winding wood-path.
He spoke fluently, as usual, but to Bridget his
talk was mechanical. Her thoughts wandered;
it seemed to her impossible to keep up the strain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of even conversation much longer. Her heart
began to beat, at first with slow, heavy throbs,
then faster and faster, as she struggled to keep
her voice steady. In spite of herself, her hands
shook. Two or three of the flowers on the top
of her basket were scattered on the path.</p>

<p>Carey stooped for them. As he put them
into the basket his hand touched hers.</p>

<p>He drew it back quickly, as though he had
been stung; and at the moment their eyes
met.</p>

<p>Bridget’s face was white.</p>

<p>“You are tired,” he said quickly, with an
effort. “You are not looking well. Let us sit
down and rest a little. I’ve walked too fast for
you. What a brute I am!”</p>

<p>Bridget sank down upon one of the great roots
across the path. She could not trust herself to
reply. An awful fear possessed her that if he
spoke to her again she should burst into tears.
She was fighting desperately, despairingly, for
self-control.</p>

<p>There was silence. Carey watched the sunlight
strike along the shining ivy leaves that
trailed towards the edge of the path. The
words of an exquisite spring song came involuntarily
to his mind as he looked at them:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Now on some twisted ivy-net,</div>
<div class="verse">Now by some twinkling rivulet.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>How did it end?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“A man had given all other bliss,</div>
<div class="verse">And all his worldly worth for this,</div>
<div class="verse">To waste his whole heart in one kiss</div>
<div class="verse">Upon her perfect lips.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He turned to her abruptly. “I’ve made up
my mind to go abroad again,” he said. “I start
in a week or two.”</p>

<p>For one second she gazed at him with wide
eyes and parted lips; then, with a half-stifled
cry, she put out both hands as though to ward
off a blow. Almost at the same moment she
rose wildly to her feet. Carey rose, too, and
caught her hands, with a startled, incredulous
exclamation.</p>

<p>“Bridget!” he whispered hoarsely. “What
do you mean? Say it,—<i>say it!</i>” he implored.
His face was close to hers, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>She cowered, and hesitated for one moment.
Then she turned and faced him.</p>

<p>“Say your part first,” she said, looking at
him with a long, steady gaze.</p>

<p>He drew himself up. “I love you!” he said.
“And you?”</p>

<p>“I love you!” she repeated, in a low, vibrating
voice. The color rushed into her face as
she said the words.</p>

<p>Carey’s arms closed round her, and she lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
her lips to his. She freed herself presently.
She was trembling from head to foot, but she
smiled radiantly, meeting his eager eyes. At
the sight of her face he groaned. “Bridget,”
he began, “what have I done—?”</p>

<p>“You have dared to tell the truth. You
have made me the happiest woman in the
world!” she replied simply. “But why didn’t
you tell me before? I—I believe I’ve got
quite thin.” She pulled the sleeve of her dress
away from her wrist, and held it out to him
with a little laugh, which held tears.</p>

<p>He seized both her slender hands, and put
them passionately to his lips.</p>

<p>“My love!—Bridget—I didn’t guess,” he
began, incoherently. In the midst of her
tremulous joy she was startled to see him so
moved, so almost terribly shaken. His imperturbable
coolness had been one of the qualities
she had first noticed as peculiar to him; it had
always filled her with something between admiration
and amusement. His vehemence almost
frightened her.</p>

<p>“I thought the suffering was all on my side,”
he said. “Bridget, I’ve endured the torture of
the damned these last few months!” He tightened
his grasp on her hands till it hurt her.
“I kept away; how I did it, I don’t know; but
I kept away from you because I couldn’t trust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
myself. I was afraid you would know it, and
it would worry you. Poor child!—and you have
trouble enough already.” His voice suddenly
dropped into infinite tenderness for her.</p>

<p>The tears sprang to Bridget’s eyes. With a
sudden movement she laid her cheek caressingly
against his hand.</p>

<p>“My darling!” he whispered, holding her
close. “You know what it means? Bridget,
you poor little girl, have you thought?”</p>

<p>She drew herself away.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, with downcast eyes. “I
know there’s a battle coming. We shall have
to decide—I know that; but, Larry, I <i>can’t</i>
think of it now. There’s no room in my heart
for anything but joy! Dear, let us have our
moment! We shall have plenty of time to
think,—plenty of time!” she repeated sadly.</p>

<p>He knelt beside her, murmuring her name
in a half-incredulous voice. “This day, at
least, is ours,” he said triumphantly, defiantly.
“Nothing can take it from us!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Trelawneys spent their honeymoon in
Paris; and since June, they had been stopping
at a little village on the coast of Normandy,
which several of Jim’s artist friends had also
chosen as headquarters.</p>

<p>Bridget was spending her holiday with them.
A fortnight of it had passed already, when she
and Helen spent one brilliant morning on the
cliffs. The August sun blazed royally in a hot
blue sky.</p>

<p>On a hill, above the coast, the little gray
church of St. Marguerite overlooked the sea.
Below it, clothing the hillside with a sheet of
rose-pink and purple blossoms, a field of clover
swept downwards towards a narrow cleft in the
chalk cliffs, by which the shore was reached.</p>

<p>The sides of the gully were dazzling white
in the hot sunshine. A line of scarlet poppies
made a vivid fringe of color along its lip. From
out its white walls great tufts of lavender-colored
scabious sprang, and trails of lady’s-slipper
flamed yellow in the sunlight. A drowsy hum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
of innumerable bees amongst the clover filled
the hot, still air, mingled with the shrill whirr
of grasshoppers. Down far below the blue sea
broke, sparkling and dimpling into millions of
flashing gems.</p>

<p>Bridget had thrown herself among the clover
blossoms at the edge of the cliff. Her shade
hat lay beside her. A scarlet sunshade was
spread above her head. At some little distance,
under the shade of a straggling elder
bush Helen sat, reading. Bridget lay very
still, listening half unconsciously to the whirr
of wings, feeling the hot sunshine wrapping her
round, her eyes fixed on the intense blue sky
above the cliffs opposite, where the swallows
were darting, wheeling, skimming in airy
dance. In one hand she held a letter. This
she presently drew noiselessly from its envelope.
She had read and re-read it a hundred
times; but now she read it once more with
careful deliberation. It was dated the day after
her walk with Carey in the Bushberry woods.
She knew by heart the words with which it
began.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... Because I love you,” it went on, “I will not
bring more trouble into your life, rashly, passionately,
as, selfish devil that I am, I long to do. You shall be free
to think—free to realize what it means if we decide to
take this step. I start for Spain to-morrow. I will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
even see you again. I <i>dare</i> not see you again. I will not
write to you. It shall be as though I don’t exist for you—for
three months. Dear, think well. I love you as I
never yet loved a woman; but though I shudder at the
mere idea of life without you, I will bear it somehow,—I
must bear it, unless you can come to me without a
single fear of consequence. I would gladly die to save
you from pain. Think well; but (I feel a brute to say it,
for it sounds as though I urge it as a plea, yet I cannot
leave it unsaid) oh, Bridget! think also that I am wild for
love of you!”</p>
</div>

<p>She read the words slowly, then she raised
the letter to her lips before she replaced it in
its envelope. For a moment longer she lay
motionless. Then she rose, gathered up her
sunshade and hat deliberately, and crossed the
grass towards her friend. She slipped down
beside her, in the shade, and laid her hand
across the open page of her book.</p>

<p>Helen looked up with a start, and their eyes
met.</p>

<p>“Bid?” she whispered, and paused. Her face
had grown suddenly white.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bridget, slowly, “I have decided.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. The shrill, insistent
whirr of the grasshoppers, mingled with the
hum of bees, was the only sound in the stillness.</p>

<p>Helen bent her head over the book on her
lap. On the open page Bridget presently saw
heavy tears falling. She raised herself to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
knees, and put her arms round her friend, and
rested her cheek caressingly against her fair
hair.</p>

<p>“Helen,” she said softly, “listen! I want to
try to explain. You have been so good,” she
faltered. “You have never worried me. It
was so like you not to harass me,—to let
me have it out with myself! But now I want
to tell you. I want to try and make you
understand. Helen, you know I haven’t come
to this decision lightly, without thought?”
There was a touch of pained reproach in the
last words, for Helen was still silent.</p>

<p>She turned to her at last.</p>

<p>“Bid,” she whispered brokenly, “you know I
trust you. You know what I think of you!
Only—only—I am <i>afraid</i>—afraid of the years
to come. Oh, Bid, laws are terrible things to
disobey! One suffers—”</p>

<p>“Yes. One suffers. I don’t expect to escape
suffering,” Bridget answered steadily. “I don’t
think I even want to.”</p>

<p>“You—you are thinking of your mother?”
Mrs. Trelawney hesitated.</p>

<p>Bridget moved restlessly, and frowned. She
plucked up a handful of grass with nervous
fingers, looked at it absently, a moment, then
threw it from her, with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“Yes. Mother, of course!” she returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
raising her head with a jerk; “but I have
thought it all out, Helen! Mother mustn’t
spoil my life. I have Larry to think of—and
myself. It sounds horrible—hateful, I know!”
she went on hastily; “but what am I to do? I
realize at last that it’s hopeless to expect that
mother will ever understand. I must take my
own path in spite of her, if I don’t want my life
spoiled—incomplete—of no use to me or any one
else!” There was silence. “I dread to
tell her,” Bridget said at last. She stirred
again restlessly, and the frown on her face
deepened. There was a note of half reckless
defiance in her tone that Helen did not understand.</p>

<p>“You see,” she went on after a pause, and
her face cleared, “I have at least no religious
scruples to overcome. Dear!” she broke off
earnestly, putting out her hand towards her
friend with a deprecatory movement. “You
understand how I say this? I know what you
believe, and I’m glad you believe it, if it
makes you happier. I don’t say it arrogantly,
Helen, but simply as a fact. I won’t even pretend
to be sure there <i>is</i> a God, and so—”</p>

<p>Helen raised her head, as if to speak.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. I know what you are going to
say!” Bridget exclaimed, “that from my standpoint
life is too terrible—too full of despair!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
It may be. But because one feels that to be
true, must one necessarily believe? <i>I</i> can’t.
We’ve talked of this often before. It is only
one other awful fact in this life of ours which
holds so much that is terrible. But,” she added
immediately, with a smile, “I won’t abuse life,
or the world. It <i>is</i> awful; but it’s beautiful
too.”</p>

<p>She paused. Her eyes travelled over the sea
of sweet-scented flowers, up to the little gray
church on the hill, and beyond it to the burning
blue of the sky.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful world,” she repeated, “and
life holds possibilities of joy too. But we are
afraid; we hesitate; we haven’t the courage
to take our happiness! I don’t <i>know</i> that there
is any life but just this one. Why should
I starve my nature? Why should I refuse
the chance of a great happiness? I don’t say
the certainty, you see, but the chance, even!
If I don’t take it I shall be forever in a gray
land, tortured with the thought that it’s my
own fault, my doing, my cowardice, perhaps.
If I do—”</p>

<p>“Yes—if you do?” Helen repeated.</p>

<p>“I don’t say we shall not both suffer,” Bridget
answered slowly. “I can’t say that. One
says contemptuously, ‘Mere prejudice,’ ‘stupid
conventions,’ and the rest; but I know enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
by experience—of the actual living of a life—to
tell me that theories are of no value beside
practice. Oh! I know; but I accept the risk.”</p>

<p>“For him too?” Helen murmured.</p>

<p>“No. He must accept or refuse it for
himself, as I do for myself,” Bridget replied
quickly. “How can one human being accept
or refuse a risk for another? We stand, each of
us, alone. We have not rushed blindly into
this, Helen. He left me absolutely free, to
make my own decision. He wouldn’t even see
me again for fear he should urge me.” Her
voice shook, “Helen, if you only knew what his
gentleness and tenderness are to me! I don’t
think you can realize it till you have had to
endure the other sort of love. <i>Love!</i>—I mean
the mere selfish passion.”</p>

<p>The last words were almost inaudible. She
held her hands tightly clasped on her lap; but
Helen saw they were shaking.</p>

<p>“My dear, I do, I do!” she said tenderly.
“Bid, you know I only want your happiness.
If this—this will give it to you, then take it.
You have thought, you have struggled—and
you are <i>Bridget</i>!” she ended, with a burst of
proud confidence.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“Bid, have you considered,” Helen began
again hesitatingly, “that there may be other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
lives for which you <i>will</i> be responsible? Perhaps
you are right about Mr. Carey. You are two
grown-up reasonable, beings; you have a right
to judge for yourselves. But your children?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have thought of that,” she said
gravely.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“If we have children,” she went on in a low
voice, “they will be born into a world which is
slowly freeing itself from the chains of prejudice,
and of hateful, perverted morality. By
the time they are old enough to understand,
there will be still more free men and women
than there are now, who dare to face realities.
<i>They</i> will be their friends. But in any case,”
she raised her big eyes, and looked full at her
friend, “I can’t help believing, Helen, that
his children and mine, would rather be born
of a man and woman who love each other,
than of a legal marriage where contempt was
the strongest feeling, on one side, at least!
Would you care to see me with a child, the
child of a father I could only pray it might
never love? If I have a child now, it will have
no legal right to its father’s name, certainly; but
I shall not bear it with shame, with self-reproach,
with terrible pity for the burden of
life I have laid upon it!” Her face was flushed
with vivid color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“If he—if Mr. Travers—divorces you, shall
you—?” Helen faltered.</p>

<p>“Marry? No. What will be the use?”
Bridget answered. “Haven’t we agreed a thousand
times that marriage <i>is</i> only a marriage so
long as there is love and tenderness on both
sides? So long as Larry’s love and tenderness
lasts for me, I shall be his wife,” she added
softly.</p>

<p>“And—if it fails?”</p>

<p>“Well, if it fails, will it be any comfort, any
compensation to me that I am his legal wife?
On the contrary, how awful—how terrible to
think that he hates the bond; chafes under it.
Oh, I know, I <i>know</i>! I’m not saying that doing
away with marriage is any cure for the sorrows
which may come. It will happen a thousand
times, of course, that love lasts on one side and
not on the other. But that is the tragedy of
life,—terrible, but inevitable. And how does
the legal bond which holds two people chained
together, when one loves and the other hates,
mend matters? I know if I loved my husband,
but he wished to be free, though it killed me,
I would say—go. Wouldn’t it be better to
endure separation, once for all, than to bear the
daily, hourly agony of seeing his indifference,
his impatience, or, worse still, of watching him
trying to disguise it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>There was a long silence. Helen turned to
her at last. Her eyes were wet with tears, but
she smiled.</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to put myself in your
place,” she said gently. “From your point of
view I think you are right. I,” she hesitated,
“<i>I</i> recognize a higher law; you don’t. Oh,
Bid, understand me! I know yours is no cheap,
unthinking unbelief. You can’t help it. Perhaps,
after all, belief or unbelief is a matter of
temperament. Anyhow, I understand, I sympathize.
You are doing what you believe to be
right. If only,” she faltered, “I knew you
were going to be happy! But, as you say, we
must leave that. In any case, God bless you,
dear!” she whispered huskily.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They walked home through the sunny fields,
where the poppies and daisies were shed broadcast
in sheets of white and scarlet. The larks
sang madly in the dazzling blue, and the steady
pulsing of the sea made a deep, slow music.
They reached the little pine-surrounded café
where they were staying, and strolled slowly up
the garden, in which the grass grew long and
rank, and purple and red zinnias blazed in the
overgrown flower-beds.</p>

<p>Madame Leroux came to the door, with a
letter in her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Pour Madame!” she said, with her large
smile, giving it to Bridget.</p>

<p>She glanced at the envelope. “I think I will
read it out here,” she said, turning to Helen.
Her voice was calm, but there was an undercurrent
of excitement in it. She turned back a few
steps to a vine-shaded arbor, where there was a
wooden table and some forms. Breakfast was
usually served out of doors at the Café des Sapins.</p>

<p>Helen went into the house. As she was crossing
the flagged passage leading to the salon, ten
minutes later, Bridget stood on the threshold.
She held the letter clasped in one hand.</p>

<p>“He is coming to-morrow,” she said, as she
passed her friend on the way upstairs. Helen
had a glimpse of her happy eyes, and turned
aside into the garden, with a half smile and a
sigh.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After they had gone upstairs that night, Mrs.
Trelawney knocked at Bridget’s bedroom door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she called, turning as the door
opened. She was sitting at the toilet-table, in
a little white wrapper, with her hair all loose
about her face.</p>

<p>“You look like a little girl again, with your
hair down,” Helen said, seating herself on the
bed, and watching her as she brushed and
arranged it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“I’ve been thinking of myself as I was, as a
little girl, to-night,” she answered, pausing,
brush in hand, to glance at herself in the glass.
Her face was grave.</p>

<p>“Helen, when this is settled I want to be quiet
and peaceful for a little while,” she said wistfully.
“We shall live abroad a great deal, I
think. I wonder if I ever <i>shall</i> be peaceful and
content,” she went on musingly. “I’m afraid
not. What an awful thing it is to have so many
moods, and to want fresh things and people
to appeal to them! Why, in some of my moods
lately, I’ve even wanted the type of person
I used to hate and despise so intensely, just as
an antidote to the simple life I was wild to lead,
when I hadn’t the chance of doing it!” She
laughed a little. “Poor Larry!” she murmured,
half laughing, half in earnest. “Will he put
up with me, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“You’re an aggravating person, but most
people put up with you,” Helen returned.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a charming way they have; I
love them for it! It’s—it’s—rather a tremendous
thing to have come to this point in
one’s life, isn’t it?” she went on presently.
She rested one elbow upon the table, and pushed
back her thick hair with the other hand. “I’ve
found myself going over all my past life to-night,
as they say you do when you’re dying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
you know. It seems to me that I’ve always
been rebellious, always struggling against something,—kicking
against the pricks, in fact.
When I left school, I used to lie awake night
after night, and listen to the shouts of drunken
men outside, divided between an agony of shame
that we had anything to do with their drunkenness,
and contempt of myself for hating my
father’s business. That was bad to bear. Then
the next rebellion was against the dreary, loveless
teacher life; after that, followed revolt
against the degrading existence of a woman
who doesn’t love her husband, but is forced to
be his slave. Now, I am up in arms against
social prejudice, which makes two people suffer
a lifetime (perhaps their only lifetime) for a
mistake which one of them has made! When
will it end, Helen?”</p>

<p>“Never, while you are alive, with that restless
mind of yours,” Helen said, a little sadly.
“You, and women like you, are born into the
wrong age for peaceful happiness, I’m afraid.
A transition age is surely the most difficult
one for a woman to live in, well,—worthily.
There’s only one thing that comforts me, Bid,”
she added after a pause, “a great thing. You
<i>love</i> this man,—I see it, I know it. You have
never loved any man before.”</p>

<p>“The only good that comes out of what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
past, as far as I can see,” Bridget replied, turning
her shining eyes upon her friend, “is that I
can compare it with this new feeling—and
trust myself. But”—she smiled with quivering
lips—“I always was an extravagant person.
My experiences, even, cost more than most
people’s!”</p>

<p>When Helen left her, she went to the window
and drew back the curtains. The moon hung
like a great white flower in the clear sky; she
fancied the sweet scent which came floating into
the room, as she pushed open the casement,
streamed from its shining heart. There were
mystic silver pathways through the pine woods
round the house, and between the black motionless
trees the distant sea shone like a lake
enchanted. The silver radiance of the night
held her spellbound. She covered her eyes
with both hands at last, and shut out the white
glitter of the moonlight. She was intoxicated
with the beauty of the world, with the joy at her
heart,—alive, clamorous, insistent. The cup
of life, brimming and honey sweet, was at her
lips at last. “<i>At last!</i>” she repeated, whispering
to herself in ecstasy, “this is my moment—this—and
to-morrow. And I thought life
had cheated me,—that it held nothing I had
dreamt of!—that I should die without—”
She sank on her knees before the window,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
and hid her happy, smiling eyes against her
folded arms.</p>

<p>A moment or two later, the breathless stillness,
which seemed to encircle her, and hold
her delight at its heart, was broken. Somewhere
in the distance, the silence was cut by
the sudden hoarse barking of a dog. She raised
her head slowly, with a long sigh, to find the
room in shadow. A cloud had floated across
the moon. There was a glint of silver on the
distant sea, but the glamour had gone from the
landscape. In a moment’s space it had grown
gray and dim. The mysterious, silver pierced
wood, was just a clump of pine-trees, overhanging
the darkening sea.</p>

<p>She felt a sudden, inexplicable contraction of
the heart. Her exalted mood was evaporating,
escaping, melting away from her. It was as
though a cloud had passed also over her mind.
She wondered vaguely why she had felt so
deliriously happy a moment since. There were
troubles,—there was suffering in store, of
course. She had said so to Helen that very day.
There was her mother, for instance. She paused.
Her forehead contracted into a frown. She had
thought out this question so many times, why
need she go through it all again? She shrugged
her shoulders impatiently. Why couldn’t she
have even one perfect hour, unspoilt by misgivings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
by self-torturing scruples? She had
decided. The thing was settled. Why couldn’t
she give herself up to her joy? She was possessed
by an impatient, impotent sense of anger
at her inability to recapture the mood of ten
minutes ago. It evaded her; it was gone. Instead,
unrest, a vague troubled sense that she was
considering the question for the first time, filled
her mind. The first time!—when she had
gone through it all, reasoned with herself every
day for months, and had finally made her
decision!</p>

<p>With a sigh she turned away from the window
at last, from the sight of the darkened wood,
and the slowly lessening streak of silver on the
sea.</p>

<p>The noise of barking was renewed; it was
answered presently by the voice of Zut, the dog
belonging to the café. Bridget paused to listen
as she unbuttoned her dressing-jacket. Zut’s
clamor increased; he was barking furiously,
and she fancied she heard a step along the
road. There was a stir, and the sound of subdued
voices overhead, and presently some one
went softly down the creaking stairs outside
her door, just as the garden gate slammed.
There was a whispered colloquy below, and then
a retreating step on the gravel path. A moment
later, there was a gentle tap at her door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Bridget drew her dressing-jacket on to her
shoulders again, in surprise, and softly crossed
the room and opened it.</p>

<p>Madame Leroux, in wrapper and bedroom
slippers, was standing outside. There was an
envelope in her hand.</p>

<p>“For Madame,” she explained—“a telegram.
There had been an error, a wrong address. It
had gone to Veules; but a telegram perhaps was
important? Monsieur Grouet’s Alphonse, who
slept at St. Marguerite’s, had brought it therefore,
at this late hour.”</p>

<p>Bridget took it from her outstretched hand,
and slowly shut the door, her eyes fixed on the
envelope. She crossed to the bed, and sat
down. Her heart began to beat violently, and
then stood still with nameless fear.</p>

<p>“If Larry—” she opened it slowly. A
moment later, the paper fluttered out of her hand
to the floor. For a long time she sat motionless,
looking straight in front of her towards
the open window. Then she rose noiselessly.
She crossed the room to the chair she had left
beside it. She was careful not to let her
dress make the slightest rustle as she sat down.
(When people were dead, you were always
quiet.) She rested her elbows on the sill presently,
still holding her breath lest she should
make the smallest sound. There was a stunned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
dazed look in her eyes. She noticed that all
but a thin streak of silver was gone from the
sea. Heavy clouds were drifting over the sky,
and the air was close and oppressive.</p>

<p>Bridget wondered idly whether the storm
would come in the night, or next day. “To-morrow,
I should think,” she murmured vaguely;
“to-morrow, perhaps.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Carey</span> walked across the wide, sunny fields next
day in the direction of the Café des Sapins.
He had driven as far as the village next to St.
Marguerite, and had decided to walk the rest of
the way. Now he was so near his journey’s
end, he dreaded to find himself actually at the
threshold. He would delay a little longer.
The rattle of the trap, and the cheerful attempts
of the driver at conversation, had become insupportable.
He wanted intensely to be alone.</p>

<p>It was noon, when, following the direction of
the blue bloused village children, he came at
last in sight of the café. A midday stillness
brooded over the hot fields, where amongst the
poppies and the white foam of daisies, a solitary
tethered cow was grazing.</p>

<p>Involuntarily he slackened his pace. His
eyes were fixed on the streak of blue sea, and
the fringe of pine-trees that bordered the cliff.
In a few moments he stood at the door of the
inn.</p>

<p>“Madame Trelawney was out,” Madame Leroux
explained. “She and Monsieur. But Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
Travers? Yes, Madame was at home. She
should be told that Monsieur awaited her.”</p>

<p>He was shown into the salon, a primitive,
stone-flagged little place. It was filled with
cool, green light, that filtered through the vine
leaves round its window. Out in the glaring
sunshine, a yellow dog lay sleeping, stretched
across the garden path. There was no other
sign of life. The stillness grew intolerable.
Carey rose and stood by the window in the
hope of feeling a breath of air, and heard his
heart beating in muffled throbs.</p>

<p>The door suddenly opened. He turned with
an effort, and saw that it was Bridget who stood
there; but he dared not look at her. She wore
a white dress, he noticed, and slowly he raised
his eyes to her face. It was almost as white as
her gown.</p>

<p>She closed the door softly behind her, and
came and stood before him.</p>

<p>He did not move.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said at last. He had framed
the word several times, but could not utter it.</p>

<p>“I want to talk to you,” she said, below her
breath. “Larry, my father is dead—I heard
last night.”</p>

<p>His face changed. A look of exquisite relief
flashed into his eyes, as he took a sudden step
towards her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Poor child! poor little Bridget!” he murmured.
“What an awful shock for you! No
wonder—”</p>

<p>She put out her hand wildly to keep him
away.</p>

<p>“Don’t—<i>don’t!</i>” she cried sharply. “I
can’t,—I can’t talk if you do!”</p>

<p>She sank helplessly into a chair opposite, and
looked up at him with despair in her face.</p>

<p>“Oh—why can’t you understand without
words? Why can’t people see into one another’s
minds? And I must talk and explain, and it’s
all no use—no good!” she cried incoherently.</p>

<p>He had pushed both hands into his pockets,
and he stood looking down at her, trying to
read her face, his own lined with mingled doubt
and fear.</p>

<p>All at once he flung himself into a chair.</p>

<p>“Yes! you must explain. I don’t understand,”
he returned doggedly. Then he leant
forward with a swift, contrite movement. “How
could I? You are ill—upset, no wonder!” he
repeated.</p>

<p>“No,” she said deliberately, keeping her voice
steady. “I’m not ill. It was a shock, of course;
it was unexpected. But father and I were
never—we didn’t understand one another,”
she added looking past him. “It isn’t as
though I had loved him very much!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>He was silent. “Then what is it?” he asked
desperately.</p>

<p>She let her eyes rest on his face for a moment
before she spoke.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t do it, Larry!” she said at last,
in an almost inaudible whisper.</p>

<p>“You mean—you can’t come with me?”</p>

<p>She bowed her head.</p>

<p>There was no sound in the little vine-shaded
salon. Carey looked out across the screen of
leaves, and noticed the motionless pine-tops
against the hot blue sky. His eyes travelled
down their red trunks to the sunny garden, to
the scarlet zinnias burning amidst the long
grass, to the curly yellow dog lying with his
nose between his paws on the hot flagstones
before the door.</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked, turning his eyes from the
garden to where Bridget sat.</p>

<p>She gave a long trembling sigh. “Because
of mother.”</p>

<p>Again a quick light of hope flashed into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes!” he said eagerly—“I see. Of
course just now—in the midst of her trouble—dear,
we must wait, of course. I—”</p>

<p>“It is not because of that,” she interrupted,
in an even toneless voice. Then, with a restless
movement—“Oh, Larry! It must come!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
I must, yet I know I <i>can’t</i> explain!” she cried,
with a sharp note of misery in her voice.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she went on, desperately. “Of
course you will think that it’s—father’s death,
that has made me see things in a new light;
but it isn’t—it isn’t. It drew the veil from
before myself—my nature—a little sooner,
that’s all. It would have come anyway,” she
murmured. “See!” she turned to him with
trembling lips—“I had decided. I had told
Helen yesterday—I had justified myself. I
told her what I had been telling myself for
weeks, that it would be mad, foolish, weak, to
let mother’s prejudices spoil my life.”</p>

<p>“And mine—” he interrupted, tersely.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>don’t</i>!” she implored, twisting her hands
together in her lap.</p>

<p>“Last night,” she went on after a moment,
“last night I was so happy!”—her voice faltered
so that he hardly heard—“but only for a little
while. Ten minutes, I think. Larry, in the
midst of my happiness, the old haunting, miserable
feeling, that I was treading down part of
my own nature in hurting mother, came back!
I—” she pushed her hair back from her white
face— “And then the telegram came; and after
a little while I saw it all: what I must do—what
my life was to be!” she added bitterly.</p>

<p>Carey looked at her a moment. He rose from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
his seat and came deliberately and knelt beside
her.</p>

<p>“All this can wait,” he said firmly. He put
his arms round her, and drew her towards him.
She hesitated for a second, then turned to him
with a cry, and put up her lips to his.</p>

<p>She drew herself away presently, shuddering
and cowering in her chair.</p>

<p>“Don’t—oh Larry, don’t! If I cry I can’t
tell you, and I must—I <i>must</i>,” she wailed—“it
must be settled now.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it must be settled now,” he said, rising
and dragging his chair closer to hers.</p>

<p>She recognized the tone, and shuddered again.
He meant to reason with her, to argue point by
point; she could never hope to explain properly,
it would last so long, such a terribly long
time!</p>

<p>“Larry, I’m worn out already!” she urged
pitifully—“don’t.”</p>

<p>“You poor little girl! We won’t talk about
it. To-morrow will do.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” she exclaimed, with feverish
haste, sitting upright. “Let it be now. I
can’t bear another night—I should go mad!
Say what you have to say now—quickly!”</p>

<p>“You say it is your mother,” Carey began.
“She will look upon this as a sin, you think?
She—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“No,” she answered wearily. “It isn’t even
that. Mother is not a religious woman in
the sense of the word. She <i>thinks</i> she is. She
goes to church, of course, and says her prayers,
but her religion doesn’t enter into her life; it
isn’t a vital thing to her. The thought of the
sin against God would not count for very much
with her, it would be the outrage against social
prejudice—the—”</p>

<p>She paused. Her voice was dry and hard.</p>

<p>Carey looked at her—puzzled, uncertain.
Her face was rigid—it told him nothing.</p>

<p>“You acknowledge this, and yet, surely the
knowledge that she would not be tortured by
fears for your soul, is much? I understand, I
realize what a fearful thought the idea of inflicting
pain of that sort must be. But you say
yourself her unhappiness will be caused merely
by the fact that you may—well, by what she
calls your social disgrace. That is hard enough,
I own; but, Bridget, will you let scruples like
these stand in the way? I mean if you are
willing to brave it for yourself, surely—”</p>

<p>He rose impetuously.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t understand—you don’t understand,”
she wailed, wringing her hands. “Don’t
you see that it doesn’t matter to me whether
her misery comes from a worthy or an unworthy
cause? The fact remains that she will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
wretched—<i>wretched</i>—and I shall have made
her wretched. <i>I</i>—her child! She has lived for
me, thought of me, worked for me early and late,
all these years—these long years! Oh, don’t
think I don’t know—don’t think I idealize her;
don’t think we are devoted even in the sense of
being friends—of being in sympathy with one
another. We are not. We haven’t a thought,
a hope, an ideal in common. We exasperate
and irritate one another continually—we always
shall. But, don’t you see? She is my <i>mother</i>,
the mother that cried over me when I was little,
because I had the toothache, or because some
one slighted me, or because—Oh!” She threw
out her hands towards him with a gesture.
“You don’t remember your mother, Larry. If
you did, you would know what these things mean—the
little baby things that make one feel the
bond, the only bond there is between us, just
the tie of blood. I’m her child. She’s my
mother. I can’t tell you any more!”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, shaken and trembling,
and hid her face in both hands.</p>

<p>Carey was silent for a time. He took one of
them and put it to his lips before he spoke.</p>

<p>“I <i>do</i> understand,” he said very gently. “But,
Bridget, think! You have done many things
already which you felt to be right, but which
must have made her suffer. Would you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
them undone? You left home, for instance,
and went out into the world. You left your
husband”—his face darkened. “Do you think
you did wrong? Dear! I know your feeling.
It is terrible, this conflict between what one owes
to one’s self, and one’s love, or obligation to
those who stand in the way. But, Bridget, what
are we to do? How will the world go on if we
are to be cramped, hindered, fettered, forever?
If we are never to be ourselves, never to take
the path that leads highest? Suppose you had
remained with your—with Travers, out of fear
of hurting your mother? You would have done
yourself a deadly injury, you—”</p>

<p>She sat silent while he spoke, and his voice
grew firm with hope as she listened; but all at
once she turned resolutely to him, and put her
hand on his.</p>

<p>“Larry,” she said brokenly, “it’s no use!
I’ve told myself all that many times. It doesn’t
alter things. It’s true I’ve made her suffer,
it’s true it couldn’t have been otherwise. There
has always, always been this fight in my life. I
should have left home long before I did if it
hadn’t been just for this very thing. Perhaps
I should never have gone at all if mother had
been alone. But she wished it at last. There
was father too, you see; and I—she saw at last
that it was impossible for me to live at home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
Then about—the other—I did it—it had to
be done in spite of her; though the thought of
her kept me with him three years. But, Larry,
don’t you see?—don’t you <i>see</i> that it was
different? I can’t disguise it from myself,
though I want to. My God! don’t you believe
I want to?” she broke out passionately, rising
as she spoke. “That was a question of mother’s
happiness against my self-respect, my decency;
this is a question of her happiness against <i>my</i>
happiness. I had a right—a right! I couldn’t
do otherwise than to buy my self-respect,
at the price even of her suffering, but I have
no right—” She stopped, leaning faintly
against the window frame.</p>

<p>“And—about me?” Carey said coldly.
“Have I no claim, Bridget? You don’t seem
to have thought of that.”</p>

<p>She turned slowly towards him, and as his
eyes met hers he felt as though he had struck
her. She made no answer, but sank down
again, with her arm thrown out against the back
of the chair, and her face hidden against it, and
broke into bitter, hopeless tears.</p>

<p>Carey stood silent a moment, with set face,
watching her. With sudden violence he stooped
and drew her from the chair into his arms.</p>

<p>“Let everything else go,” he whispered
fiercely. “We love one another. What does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
anything matter? You are the woman for me
in all the world! I am the man for you! We
belong to one another. No one—nothing—has
the right to part us. Think, Bridget. Together,
I believe we can do great things, live full lives,
drink deep of the cup of life, and find it good.
It is only offered to us once—we shall be mad
if we refuse it!”</p>

<p>She clung to him, and was silent so long that
a sense of exultant triumph began to stir at his
heart. He put her away from him a little, and
looked in her face with a smile.</p>

<p>She met his eyes steadily, and with a groan
he released her.</p>

<p>“You are like the rest of women, after all!”
he said bitterly. “You delight in sacrifice. No
wonder the wheels of Fate have crushed you—you
throw yourselves down before the car, and
invite your doom!”</p>

<p>“You are very cruel,” she answered wearily,
letting her hands fall heavily in her lap; “but
I suppose you can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought what life means for you?”
He flung out the words between his set teeth.</p>

<p>“Yes. Mother will live with me—and I
shall work.”</p>

<p>He started and looked at her for some moments
silently.</p>

<p>“Do you realize it, Bridget?” he enquired at
last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>“Perfectly,” she said calmly. “I shall work
all day. In the mornings I shall teach, in the
afternoons I shall write in my own room. The
evenings I shall usually spend in unsuccessful
attempts to keep my temper.”</p>

<p>“And what sort of woman will you be in five—ten
years’ time?”</p>

<p>“God knows!” she cried wildly, her forced
calm breaking up. “I don’t. That is nothing
to do with me! Some people would tell me—people
with lofty, high-toned minds, you know,”
she added with a sneer—“that I shall be a very
fine character, chastened, subdued, with latent
strength, and that sort of thing. Perhaps if
I were an archangel, with none of the lower
passions, I might be; but I think it’s much more
likely I shall be merely a bad tempered, irritable,
middle-aged person.”</p>

<p>“And yet—” he began.</p>

<p>She turned her head, with an exasperated,
restless movement.</p>

<p>“And yet—and yet” she repeated—“Oh,
Larry! it isn’t a question of reason, of judgment,
of anything rational. Whatever I do I
shall regret it!” she broke off recklessly.
“See! if it had been possible I would have
gone with you last night—taken the irrevocable
step, and ever afterwards cursed myself for
doing it! You talk of leading a full, worthy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
happy life!—with a woman who is eternally
self-tortured? It doesn’t matter whether it’s on
her own account or some one else’s; to live with
any one under such conditions is impossible—hopeless.
You know it!”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be so!” he urged. “You exaggerate—”</p>

<p>“I know myself better than you know me—too
well!” she interrupted. “No, it’s no use,
Larry!” She made a gesture with her hands
as of flinging something from her. “Life is too
hard for me. I can’t reason, I can’t think any
more! I can only cling blindly to this strong
instinct, a savage instinct, if you like. I think
we come back, after all, to our savage natures in
most of the big things in life. It isn’t a question
of duty, inclination, religion, or <i>anything</i>,
but just the one overwhelming necessity of not
breaking the tie of blood. Larry, you must
go,” she added, in a hoarse whisper. “I can’t—stand
it any longer.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” he said, keeping his eyes
fixed on her haggard face. His own was white
and rigid. “Do you mean that I’m to go away—abroad—not
to see you again? You don’t
mean <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>He could hardly keep his voice steady enough
to frame the last question.</p>

<p>She raised her head slowly, and looked in his
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“Larry,” she said at last, under her breath,
“what am I doing this for? Is it that I’m
afraid for myself? You know it is not! But
you know as well as I do that if you stay, and—there
is talk, as there will be—our names
coupled together—I might just as well—better—have
gone with you, in the face of the world.
Besides, for my own sake—” she lifted her
head proudly, “I couldn’t live a life like—a
life of deception.” She paused. “But for
mother—I would have gone with you—to
the ends of the earth. You know it. But—”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. A film of thick
white clouds had gathered over the sun; the air
was heavy, breathlessly quiet. At the window,
the vine leaves hung straight and still, not a
tendril stirred.</p>

<p>At last Carey moved. He raised both her
hands to his lips. “Forgive me!” he said
brokenly.</p>

<p>She flung out her arms with a cry, and they
closed round him. She shed no tears, but her
whole body was shaken with her sobs.</p>

<p>At last she pushed him from her.</p>

<p>“Go—go!” she implored. “I can’t—don’t
come back.”</p>

<p>“I will go,” he said. He started at the sound
of his own voice. “I will not come back—unless
you send for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“I—I pray I never may. If I can bear it I—oh,
go! only <i>go</i>!” she cried incoherently.</p>

<p>She dragged herself to the window and
watched him with wide, dry eyes, as he went
down the garden path. His footsteps, crunching
the gravel, sounded loud and harsh in the
stillness.</p>

<p>“He stoops like an old man. He didn’t
stoop this morning,” she thought idly. “I
wonder if I stoop?” She turned and glanced at
herself in the little mirror opposite the window.
“No; I’m young, dreadfully young. I have—how
many more years to live? How old am
I? I can’t count, I never <i>could</i> reckon.” She
smiled a little to herself, and caught sight of
her face in the glass. “I wonder if I’m going
mad?” she murmured listlessly.</p>

<p>A heavy drop fell on one of the vine leaves
outside, it swayed, and tossed it lower; another—and
then the first low growl of thunder.</p>

<p>Helen hurried up the garden path, spoke a
word to Madame Leroux, and opened the door
of the salon.</p>

<p>The vine-leaf screen at the window made the
room almost dark, and the patter of rain on the
leaves was the only sound as she crossed to
where Bridget sat crouched in her chair.</p>

<p>“Bid, dearest!” she whispered, her voice
almost lost in the second louder peal of thunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>Bridget turned to her with a wan smile, and
she almost cried aloud at the sight of her face
in the gloom.</p>

<p>“I’ve sent him away,” she explained, “do I
look rather dreadful? Never mind. When we
go back—to-morrow, is it?—I want you to
choose rooms for mother and me.”</p>

<p>A very remarkable story, which in a coarser hand than its refined and
gifted author could never have been effectively told; for such a hand could
not have sustained the purity of motive, nor have portrayed the noble,
irreproachable character of Herminia Barton.—<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p>

<p>“The Woman Who Did” is a remarkable and powerful story. It
increases our respect for Mr. Allen’s ability, nor do we feel inclined to join
in throwing stones at him as a perverter of our morals and our social institutions.
However widely we may differ from Mr. Allen’s views on many
important questions, we are bound to recognize his sincerity, and to respect
him accordingly. It is powerful and painful, but it is not convincing.
Herminia Barton is a woman whose nobleness both of mind and of life we
willingly concede; but as she is presented to us by Mr. Allen, there is unmistakably
a flaw in her intellect. This in itself does not detract from
the reality of the picture.—<i>The Speaker.</i></p>

<p>In the work itself, every page, and in fact every line, contains outbursts
of intellectual passion that places this author among the giants of the
nineteenth century.—<i>American Newsman.</i></p>

<p>Interesting, and at times intense and powerful.—<i>Buffalo Commercial.</i></p>

<p>No one can doubt the sincerity of the author.—<i>Woman’s Journal.</i></p>

<p>The story is a strong one, very strong, and teaches a lesson that no one
has a right to step aside from the moral path laid out by religion, the law,
and society.—<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>George Egerton’s new volume entitled “Discords,” a collection of short stories,
is more talked about, just now, than any other fiction of the day. The collection is
really stories for story-writers. They are precisely the quality which literary folk will
wrangle over. Harold Frederic cables from London to the “New York Times” that
the book is making a profound impression there. It is published on both sides, the
Roberts House bringing it out in Boston. George Egerton, like George Eliot and
George Sand, is a woman’s <i>nom de plume</i>. The extraordinary frankness with which
life in general is discussed in these stories not unnaturally arrests attention.—<i>Lilian
Whiting.</i></p>

<p>The English woman, known as yet only by the name of George Egerton, who
made something of a stir in the world by a volume of strong stories called “Keynotes,”
has brought out a new book under the rather uncomfortable title of “Discords.”
These stories show us pessimism run wild; the gloomy things that can happen to a
human being are so dwelt upon as to leave the impression that in the author’s own
world there is no light. The relations of the sexes are treated of in bitter irony, which
develops into actual horror as the pages pass. But in all this there is a rugged
grandeur of style, a keen analysis of motive, and a deepness of pathos that stamp
George Egerton as one of the greatest women writers of the day. “Discords” has
been called a volume of stories; it is a misnomer, for the book contains merely varying
episodes in lives of men and women, with no plot, no beginning nor ending.—<i>Boston
Traveller.</i></p>

<p>This is a new volume of psychological stories from the pen and brains of George
Egerton, the author of “Keynotes.” Evidently the titles of the author’s books are
selected according to musical principles. The first story in the book is “A Psychological
Moment at Three Periods.” It is all strength rather than sentiment. The
story of the child, of the girl, and of the woman is told, and told by one to whom the
mysteries of the life of each are familiarly known. In their very truth, as the writer
has so subtly analysed her triple characters, they sadden one to think that such things
must be; yet as they are real, they are bound to be disclosed by somebody and in due
time. The author betrays remarkable penetrative skill and perception, and dissects
the human heart with a power from whose demonstration the sensitive nature may
instinctively shrink even while fascinated with the narration and hypnotized by the
treatment exhibited.—<i>Courier.</i></p>

<p>A capable critic writes: “One of the most beautiful, touching stories I have
read. The character of the old clerk is a masterpiece, a kind of Russian Charles
Lamb. He reminds me, too, of Anatole France’s ‘Sylvestre Bonnard,’ but it
is a more poignant, moving figure. How wonderfully, too, the sad little strokes
of humor are blended into the pathos in his characterization, and how fascinating
all the naive self-revelations of his poverty become,—all his many ups and downs
and hopes and fears. His unsuccessful visit to the money-lender, his despair at the
office, unexpectedly ending in a sudden burst of good fortune, the final despairing
cry of his love for Varvara,—these hold one breathless. One can hardly
read them without tears.... But there is no need to say all that could be said
about the book. It is enough to say that it is over powerful and beautiful.”</p>

<p>We are glad to welcome a good translation of the Russian Dostoievsky’s
story “Poor Folk,” Englished by Lena Milman. It is a tale of unrequited love,
conducted in the form of letters written between a poor clerk and his girl cousin
whom he devotedly loves, and who finally leaves him to marry a man not admirable
in character who, the reader feels, will not make her happy. The pathos of
the book centres in the clerk, Makar’s, unselfish affection and his heart-break at
being left lonesome by his charming kinswoman whose epistles have been his one
solace. In the conductment of the story, realistic sketches of middle class Russian
life are given, heightening the effect of the denouement. George Moore writes
a sparkling introduction to the book.—<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>Dostoievsky is a great artist. “Poor Folk” is a great novel.—<i>Boston
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>It is a most beautiful and touching story, and will linger in the mind long
after the book is closed. The pathos is blended with touching bits of humor,
that are even pathetic in themselves.—<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>Notwithstanding that “Poor Folk” is told in that most exasperating and
entirely unreal style—by letters—it is complete in sequence, and the interest
does not flag as the various phases in the sordid life of the two characters are
developed. The theme is intensely pathetic and truly human, while its treatment
is exceedingly artistic. The translator, Lena Milman, seems to have well
preserved the spirit of the original.—<i>Cambridge Tribune.</i></p>
